20thCentury doubling in dust archived in an Antarctic Peninsula ice core parallels climate change and desertification in South America,,"Conclusions Our high-resolution ice core record of aluminum from the northern Antarctic Peninsula suggests that aluminosilicate dust in the local atmosphere doubled during the 20th century. These results are in agreement with previously reported decadal records of insoluble dust particle flux from two ice cores from the central and southern Antarctic Peninsula (13, 14), suggesting that the region of increased 20th-century dust f lux may be extensive. Although it is not possible to quantify how much of the recent doubling in dust levels at James Ross Island might be associated only with land-use changes, it is likely that overgrazing and deforestation together with global warming have led to desertification and thus to increased dust mobility and export from southern South America (7, 30). Atmospheric crustal dust also supplies iron, an essential nutrient for phytoplankton, to ocean surface waters and may indirectly affect climate by modulating the biological export of carbon to the deep ocean (3, 41). Relatively high surface water chlorophyll to the north of James Ross Island has been found to be highly correlated with present day Patagonian dust deposition (42). We hypothesize","['South America', 'Island', 'Antarctic Peninsula']"

A comparison of 1701 snow models using observations from an alpine site,,"Even the more physically-based parameterizations of snow pro- cesses contain parameters with values that are not well con- strained by observations or theory, and it is as easy to obtain poor model performance with poor choices of parameter values as it is with poor choices of model structure. Calibrating the parameters in a land surface model for global atmospheric model- ling applications is not straightforward, but models are often cali- brated for hydrological applications, and the organizers of intercomparison projects sometimes make a subset of the evalua- tion data available to allow a degree of model calibration. A full cal- ibration of JIM has not been attempted, but configuration number 1700 (2022222), which performed poorly in the original simula- tions, has been calibrated by random sampling of the five parame- ters amax, amin, d0, Tc and z0 to minimize the cost function for 2006?€? 2007. Errors for snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface tem- perature are given in Table 10 for the uncalibrated and calibrated configuration, compared with errors for configuration number 849 (1011110) which performed well without calibration. Errors for the poorly performing configuration are greatly reduced by cal- ibration, but the overall performance of a configuration that per- forms well without calibration is not matched. 7.

A conceptual model of water yield effects from beetleinduced tree death in snowdominated lodgepole pine forests,"In regions of western North America with snow-dominated hydrology, the presence of forested watersheds can significantly influence streamflow compared to areas with other vegetation cover types. Widespread tree death in these watersheds can thus dramatically alter many ecohydrologic processes including transpiration, canopy solar transmission and snow interception, subcanopy wind regimes, soil infiltration, forest energy storage and snow surface albedo.One of themore important causes of conifer tree death is bark beetle infestation, which in some instances will kill nearly all of the canopy trees within forest stands. Since 1996, an ongoing outbreak of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) has caused widespread mortality across more than 600,000km2 of coniferous forests in western North America, including numerous RockyMountain headwaters catchments with high rates of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) mortality frommountain pin beetle (Dendroctonous ponderosae) infestations. Few empirical studies have documented the effects of MPB infestations on hydrologic processes, and little is known about the direction and magnitude of changes in water yield and timing of runoff due to insect- induced tree death. Here, we review and synthesize existing research and provide new results quantifying the effects of beetle infestations on canopy structure, snow interception and transmission to create a conceptualmodel of the hydrologic effects ofMPB-induced lodgepole pine death during different stages of mortality. We identify the primary hydrologic processes operating in living forest stands, stands in multiple stages of death and long-dead stands undergoing regeneration and estimate the direction of change in new water yield. This conceptual model is intended to identify avenues for future research efforts. Copyright ?? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,['North America']
A coupled 1D atmosphere and 3D canopy radiative transfer model for canopy reflectance light environment and photosynthesis simulation in a heterogeneous ,Received 9 February 2007; received in revised form 21 April 2007; accepted 21 April 2007 Abstract,"Canopy shape affects the magnitude of canopy photosyn- thesis. Photosynthesis in cone-shaped canopy case is higher than that in sphere canopy case. This is mainly due to the difference of the area that is faced on the solar direction. The canopy with larger projected area for solar direction can perform more photosynthesis. Fig. 14 (right) shows the AOT depen- dency of the light use efficiency (LUE). LUE gradually increase with increase in AOT. However its slope and absolute values depends on the canopy structure and LAI. In cone canopy cases, LUE has similar patterns in three different LAI cases. In contrast, LUE in sphere canopy cases is quite different. This simulation suggests that LAI is not the only parameter to determine the photosynthesis in heterogeneous landscape. For detail understanding of forest canopy photosynthesis, both angular geometry of incident PAR at TOC and 3-D canopy structure should be examined. 5. Conclusion",[]
A deterministic method to characterize canopy radiative transfer properties,"Investigations of snowcover dynamics beneath vegetation canopies require either measured or estimated solar and thermal radiation values at the snow surface. A deterministic method is presented that uses portable arrays of pyranometers and pyrgeometers to quantify the amount of incoming radiation at the snow surface. Example solar and thermal radiation datasets are presented from boreal deciduous, boreal coniferous and temperate coniferous forest stands. The data indicate that the canopies transmitted 33% (4?€?8 March), 15% (6?€?10 February), and 3% (22?€?24 September) of the above-canopy radiation. In the boreal deciduous and temperate conifer stands, thermal radiation is increased by 25% and 34% respectively. Thermal gains partially offset solar reduction, such that incoming all- wave radiation is decreased by 22% and 25% respectively for each of these stands. When recorded at a high temporal resolution, array data can estimate below-canopy diffuse solar radiation values for estimation techniques that treat direct and diffuse transmission independently. We provide examples of how radiometer array data are used to derive simple canopy radiation transmissivity parameters for global, beam and diffuse radiation. Radiometer arrays also provide data for detailed investigations to assess within-stand radiation variability, or to investigate radiation variations across land cover discontinuities, to advance our understanding of snowcover energetics in complex environments.

A Hierarchical Statistical Framework for Emergent Constraints Application to SnowAlbedo Feedback,"Abstract Emergent constraints use relationships between future and current climate states to constrain projections of climate response. Here, we introduce a statistical, hierarchical emergent con- straint (HEC) framework in order to link future and current climate with observations. Un- der Gaussian assumptions, the mean and variance of the future state is shown analytically to be a function of the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio between data-model error and current- climate uncertainty, and the correlation between future and current climate states. We apply the HEC to the climate-change, snow-albedo feedback, which is related to the seasonal cy- cle in the Northern Hemisphere. We obtain a snow-albedo-feedback prediction interval of (???1.25,???0.58) %K???1. The critical dependence on SNR and correlation shows that neglect- ing these terms can lead to bias and under-estimated uncertainty in constrained projections. The flexibility of using HEC under general assumptions throughout the Earth System is dis- cussed.","Projections of change in the Earth System from anthropogenic forcing is one of the defining challenges in climate science. ECs represent an important approach to incorporat- ing observations into climate-model projections that relate present-day variability to future response. In this work, ECs are explicitly defined through Equation 3 as conditional distri- butions within a HEC framework. Classical EC studies frequently use a linear regression but do not account for both the correlation between zt+?? and xt and the precision in observing xt with yt as does HEC. The formulation of the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) solution in Equation 17 more directly links EC with data assimilation techniques. For non-Gaussian pro- cesses, more advanced tools such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) could be used to compute accurate prediction intervals based on the HEC [Cressie and Wikle, 2011].",[]

A hydrometric and geochemical approach to test the transmissivity feedback hypothesis during snowmelt,"To test the transmissivity feedback hypothesis of runoff generation, surface and subsurface waters were monitored and sampled during the 1996 snowmelt at various topographic positions in a 41 ha forested headwater catchment at Sleepers River, Vermont. Two conditions that promote transmissivity feedback existed in the catchment during the melt period. First, saturated hydraulic conductivity increased toward land surface, from a geometric mean of 3.6 mm h21 in glacial till to 25.6 mm h21 in deep soil to 54.0 mm h21 in shallow soil. Second, groundwater levels rose to within 0.3 m of land surface at all riparian sites and most hillslope sites at peak melt. The importance of transmissivity feedback to streamflow generation was tested at the catchment scale by examination of physical and chemical patterns of groundwater in near-stream (discharge) and hillslope (recharge/lateral flow) zones, and within a geomorphic hollow (convergent flow).","Hydrometric and geochemical evidence support the transmissivity feedback hypothesis of streamflow generation during snowmelt in the W-9 catchment. Saturated hydraulic conductivity increased toward land surface, and groundwater levels rose close to land surface even at hillslope sites during snowmelt.",[]

A modeling and rendering method for snow by using metaballs,"Abstract The display of natural scenes such as mountains, trees, the earth as viewed from space, the sea, and waves have been attempted. Here a method to realistically display snow is proposed. In order to achieve this, two important elements have to be considered, namely the shape and shading model of snow, based on the physical phenomenon. In this paper, a method for displaying snow fallen onto objects, including curved surfaces and snow scattered by objects, such as skis, is proposed. Snow should be treated as particles with a density distribution since it consists of water particles, ice particles, and air molecules. In order to express the material property of snow, the phase functions of the particles must be taken into account, and it is well-known that the color of snow is white because of the multiple scattering of light. This paper describes a calculation method for light scattering due to snow particles taking into account both multiple scattering and sky light, and the modeling of snow. Note: snow, multiple scattering, Mie scattering, metaball, volume rendering","We have proposed an algorithm for a physical based image synthesis of clouds and snow.

A multilayer physically based snowpack model simulating direct and indirect radiative impacts of lightabsorbing impurities in snow,"Abstract. Light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) decrease snow albedo, increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed by the snowpack. Its most intuitive and direct impact is to ac- celerate snowmelt. Enhanced energy absorption in snow also modifies snow metamorphism, which can indirectly drive further variations of snow albedo in the near-infrared part of the solar spectrum because of the evolution of the near- surface snow microstructure. New capabilities have been im- plemented in the detailed snowpack model SURFEX/ISBA- Crocus (referred to as Crocus) to account for impurities?€? de- position and evolution within the snowpack and their direct and indirect impacts. Once deposited, the model computes impurities?€? mass evolution until snow melts out, accounting for scavenging by meltwater. Taking advantage of the recent inclusion of the spectral radiative transfer model TARTES (Two-stream Analytical Radiative TransfEr in Snow model) in Crocus, the model explicitly represents the radiative im- pacts of light-absorbing impurities in snow. The model was evaluated at the Col de Porte experimental site (French Alps) during the 2013?€?2014 snow season against in situ standard snow measurements and spectral albedo measurements. In situ meteorological measurements were used to drive the snowpack model, except for aerosol deposition fluxes. Black carbon (BC) and dust deposition fluxes used to drive the model were extracted from simulations of the atmospheric model ALADIN-Climate. The model simulates snowpack evolution reasonably, providing similar performances to our reference Crocus version in terms of snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), near-surface specific surface area (SSA) and shortwave albedo. Since the reference empirical","In this study, new developments aiming at modeling the deposition and the evolution of light-absorbing impurities within the snowpack are introduced in the detailed snow- pack model Crocus. We implemented the dry and wet de- position of a user-defined number of LAI species. The de- position fluxes can either be extracted from an atmospheric model as in this study or forced by user-prescribed deposition rates as in Charrois et al. (2016). The fate of the aerosols de- posited in the snow is computed by mass-conservation evo- lution laws for impurity mass content as snowpack evolves. Finally, we use the radiative transfer model TARTES embed- ded into Crocus to explicitly account for the direct and indi- rect radiative impact of the LAIs evolving in the snowpack.","['Col de Porte', 'de Porte', 'Charrois']"
A multiscale perspective of water pulses in dryland ecosystems climatology and ecohydrology of the western USA,"Abstract In dryland ecosystems, the timing and magni- tude of precipitation pulses drive many key ecological processes, notably soil water availability for plants and soil microbiota. Plant available water has frequently been viewed simply as incoming precipitation, yet processes at larger scales drive precipitation pulses, and the subsequent transformation of precipitation pulses to plant available water are complex. We provide an overview of the factors that influence the spatial and temporal availability of water to plants and soil biota using examples from western USA drylands. Large spatial- and temporal-scale drivers of regional precipitation patterns include the position of the jet streams and frontal boundaries, the North American Monsoon, El Ni??o Southern Oscillation events, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Topography and orography modify the patterns set up by the larger-scale drivers, resulting in regional patterns (102?€?106 km2) of precipita- tion magnitude, timing, and variation. Together, the large- scale and regional drivers impose important pulsed patterns on long-term precipitation trends at landscape scales, in which most site precipitation is received as small",,"['USA', 'Pacific']"

A physical model to determine snowfall over land by microwave radiometry,"Abstract?€?Falling snow is an important component of global precipitation in extratropical regions. This paper describes the methodology and results of physically based retrievals of snow falling over land surfaces. Because microwave brightness tem- peratures emitted by snow-covered surfaces are highly variable, precipitating snow above such surfaces is difficult to observe using window channels that occur at low frequencies ( 100 GHz). Furthermore, at frequencies 37 GHz, sensitivity to liquid hydrometeors is dominant. These problems are mitigated at high frequencies ( 100 GHz) where water vapor screens the surface emission, and sensitivity to frozen hydrometeors is signifi- cant. However, the scattering effect of snowfall in the atmosphere at those higher frequencies is also impacted by water vapor in the upper atmosphere. The theory of scattering by randomly oriented dry snow particles at high microwave frequencies appears to be better described by regarding snow as a concatenation of ?€?equivalent?€? ice spheres rather than as a sphere with the effective dielectric constant of an air?€?ice mixture. An equivalent sphere snow scattering model was validated against high-frequency attenuation measurements. Satellite-based high-frequency obser- vations from an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) instrument during the March 5?€?6, 2001 New England blizzard were used to retrieve snowfall over land. Vertical distributions of snow, temperature, and relative humidity profiles were derived from the Mesoscale Model (MM5) cloud model. Those data were applied and modified in a radiative transfer model that derived brightness temperatures consistent with the AMSU-B observa- tions. The retrieved snowfall distribution was validated with radar reflectivity measurements obtained from a ground-based radar network.",,['New England']

A prototype AMSRE global snow area and snow depth algorithm,"Abstract?€?A methodologically simple approach to estimate snow depth from spaceborne microwave instruments is described. The scattering signal observed in multifrequency passive mi- crowave data is used to detect snow cover. Wet snow, frozen ground, precipitation, and other anomalous scattering signals are screened using established methods. The results from two different approaches (a simple time and continentwide static approach and a space and time dynamic approach) to estimating snow depth were compared. The static approach, based on radiative transfer calculations, assumes a temporally constant grain size and density. The dynamic approach assumes that snowpack properties are spatially and temporally dynamic and requires two simple empirical models of density and snowpack grain radius evolution, plus a dense media radiative transfer model based on the quasicrystalline approximation and sticky particle theory. To test the approaches, a four-year record of daily snow depth measurements at 71 meteorological stations plus passive microwave data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager, land cover data and a digital elevation model were used. In addition, testing was performed for a global dataset of over 1000 World Me- teorological Organization meteorological stations recording snow depth during the 2000?€?2001 winter season. When compared with the snow depth data, the new algorithm had an average error of 23 cm for the one-year dataset and 21 cm for the four-year dataset (131% and 94% relative error, respectively). More importantly, the dynamic algorithm tended to underestimate the snow depth less than the static algorithm. This approach will be developed further and implemented for use with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer?€?Earth Observing System aboard Aqua.",,[]

A sensitivity study of daytime net radiation during snowmelt to forest canopy and atmospheric conditions,,"This study examined the sensitivity of subcanopy net radiation components during snowmelt to canopy char- acteristics with reference to atmospheric conditions. A simple model was derived from meteorological obser- vations in a spruce forest in the Yukon Territory, Canada (608N), and in a pine forest in Colorado (408N). As the snow surface beneath a canopy is not greatly cooled during the night, the daily sum of the positive values of the net radiation was used as an index of the snowmelt rate. The dependence of subcanopy net radiation over snow to canopy characteristics was described in terms of mean shortwave transmissivity and sky-view factor.","['Colorado', 'Canada']"

A simulation of the global distribution and radiative forcing of soil dust aerosols at the Last Glacial Maximum,"Abstract. In this study an integrated simulation of the global distribution and the radiative forcing of soil dust aerosols at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is performed with an aerosol climate model, SPRINTARS. It is compared with another simulation for the present climate condition. The global total emission flux of soil dust aerosols at the LGM is simulated to be about 2.4 times as large as that in the present climate, and the simulated deposition flux is in general agree- ment with estimations from ice core and marine sediment samplings though it appears to be underestimated over the Antarctic. The calculated direct radiative forcings of soil dust aerosols at the LGM is close to zero at the tropopause and ???0.4 W m???2 at the surface. These radiative forcings are about twice as large as those in the present climate. SPRINT- ARS also includes the microphysical parameterizations of the cloud-aerosol interaction both for liquid water and ice crystals, which affect the radiation budget. The positive ra- diative forcing from the indirect effect of soil dust aerosols is mainly caused by their properties to act as ice nuclei. This effect is simulated to be smaller (???0.9 W m???2) at the LGM than in the present. It is suggested that atmospheric dust might contribute to the cold climate during the glacial pe- riods both through the direct and indirect effects, relative to the interglacial periods.",,[]

A synthesis of atmospheric mercury depletion event chemistry in the atmosphere and snow,"Abstract. It was discovered in 1995 that, during the spring time, unexpectedly low concentrations of gaseous elemen- tal mercury (GEM) occurred in the Arctic air. This was surprising for a pollutant known to have a long residence time in the atmosphere; however conditions appeared to exist in the Arctic that promoted this depletion of mercury (Hg). This phenomenon is termed atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) and its discovery has revolutionized our understanding of the cycling of Hg in Polar Regions while stimulating a significant amount of research to understand its impact to this fragile ecosystem. Shortly after the discov- ery was made in Canada, AMDEs were confirmed to occur throughout the Arctic, sub-Artic and Antarctic coasts. It is now known that, through a series of photochemically ini- tiated reactions involving halogens, GEM is converted to a","During the last decade a great leap in our understanding of Hg transformation in the Arctic and the Antarctic atmo- sphere has occurred, especially in measurement, laboratory and modeling studies. The goal of this review article is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the state of the Hg science in Polar Regions since the discovery of AMDEs. Taken in total, these studies frame our current understand- ing of the roles that atmospheric chemistry, Hg speciation, Hg deposition, snow and ice processes and photochemical reactions play in driving the fascinating Hg cycling in this environment. Prioritizing future research directions is diffi- cult because of the interdisciplinary nature of Polar Hg stud- ies that incorporate work from atmospheric chemists, sea ice and snow chemists, modelers, laboratory experimental- ists and ecosystem biogeochemists. Here we will attempt to summarize where the current state of knowledge lies with an eye to the future research efforts and results that are needed to move the state of knowledge further. We will first start with what is generally considered well known and then will transi- tion toward the major gaps in our knowledge base. As earlier stated, the changing climate and emissions sources over the next 20 years will dramatically affect the source, deposition and long term fate of Hg deposited to Polar Regions. The effects of these changes on the AMDE processes that deposit Hg to the Arctic and Antarctic are, as of yet, unknown.","['Arctic', 'Antarctic']"

A WRF simulation of the impact of 3D radiative transfer on surface hydrology over the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada,"Abstract. We investigate 3-D mountains/snow effects on so- lar flux distributions and their impact on surface hydrology over the western United States, specifically the Rocky Moun- tains and Sierra Nevada. The Weather Research and Forecast- ing (WRF) model, applied at a 30 km grid resolution, is used in conjunction with a 3-D radiative transfer parameterization covering a time period from 1 November 2007 to 31 May 2008, during which abundant snowfall occurred. A compar- ison of the 3-D WRF simulation with the observed snow water equivalent (SWE) and precipitation from Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites shows reasonable agreement in terms of spatial patterns and daily and seasonal variability, although the simulation generally has a positive precipita- tion bias. We show that 3-D mountain features have a pro- found impact on the diurnal and monthly variation of surface radiative and heat fluxes, and on the consequent elevation- dependence of snowmelt and precipitation distributions. In particular, during the winter months, large deviations (3-D- PP, in which PP denotes the plane-parallel approach) of the monthly mean surface solar flux are found in the morning and afternoon hours due to shading effects for elevations below 2.5 km. During spring, positive deviations shift to the earlier morning. Over mountaintops higher than 3 km, positive devi- ations are found throughout the day, with the largest values of 40?€?60 W m???2 occurring at noon during the snowmelt season of April to May. The monthly SWE deviations averaged over the entire domain show an increase in lower elevations due to reduced snowmelt, which leads to a reduction in cumula- tive runoff. Over higher elevation areas, positive SWE devia- tions are found because of increased solar radiation available",,"['Rocky Mountains', 'Sierra Nevada', 'Sierra Nevada.']"
Absorbing aerosols contribution of biomass burning and implications for radiative forcing,"Abstract. Absorbing aerosols supplements the global warm- ing caused by greenhouse gases. However, unlike green- house gases, the effect of absorbing aerosol on climate is not known with certainty owing to paucity of data. Also, uncer- tainty exists in quantifying the contributing factors whether it is biomass or fossil fuel burning. Based on the obser- vations of absorption coefficient at seven wavelengths and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at five wavelengths carried out at Gadanki (13.5??? N, 79.2???

Absorption of light by soot particles determination of the absorption coefficient by means of aethalometers,"During a soot aerosol measurement campaign the response of two di*erent aethalometers (AE10 with white light and AE30 with multiwavelength capability) to several types of soot was investigated. Diesel soot, spark-generated carbon particles, and mixtures of these soot particles with ammonium sulfate and oxidation products of ???-pinene were used in this evaluation. The determination of the particles light absorption coe%cient (babs) with the AE10 aethalometer is a di%cult task because of an ill-de7ned spectral sensitivity of this instrument. Provided that the proper numerical corrections are performed, the AE30 instrument allows for the measurement of babs over a wide spectral range (??? = 450?€?950 nm). During all experiments it was found that with increasing 7lter load the optical path in the aethalometer 7lter decreased. As a result, an increased underestimation of the measured aethalometer signals (babs or black carbon mass concentrations) occurs with increasing 7lter loads. This e*ect, which is attributed to a ?€?shadowing?€? of the particles in the 7ber matrix, is very pronounced for ?€?pure?€? soot particles while almost negligible for aged atmospheric aerosols. An empirical correction for this bias is presented and requires information on the light scattering behavior (i.e. light scattering coe%cient) of the sampled particles. Without this additional information, the applicability of the instruments is limited. Comparison with a reference method shows that multiple scattering in the nearly unloaded 7ber 7lter is responsible for enhanced light absorption by a factor of about 2.14. ? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Accumulation of aerosols over the IndoGangetic plains and southern slopes of the Himalayas distribution properties and radiative effects during the 2009 pre ,"Abstract. We examine the distribution of aerosols and asso- ciated optical/radiative properties in the Gangetic-Himalayan region from simultaneous radiometric measurements over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and the foothill/southern slopes of the Himalayas during the 2009 pre-monsoon sea- son. Enhanced dust transport extending from the South- west Asian arid regions into the IGP, results in seasonal mean (April?€?June) aerosol optical depths of over 0.6 ?€? high- est over Southern Asia. The influence of dust loading is greater over the Western IGP as suggested by pronounced coarse mode peak in aerosol size distribution and spectral single scattering albedo (SSA). Transported dust in the IGP, driven by prevailing westerly airmass, is found to be more absorbing (SSA550 nm <0.9) than the near-desert region in Northwestern (NW) India suggesting mixing with carbona- ceous aerosols in the IGP. On the contrary, significantly reduced dust transport is observed over eastern IGP and foothill/elevated Himalayan slopes in Nepal where strongly absorbing haze is prevalent, as indicated by lower SSA (0.85?€?0.9 at 440?€?1020 nm), suggesting presence of more ab- sorbing aerosols compared to IGP.

Standard products include daily and 8-day composite 500 m resolution swath and tile products (which include fractional snow cover (FSC) and snow albedo), and 0??05?? resolution products on a climate-modelling grid (CMG) (which also include FSC). These snow products (from Collection 4 (C4) reprocessing) are mature and most have been validated to varying degrees and are available to order through the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The overall absolute accuracy of the well-studied 500 m resolution swath (MOD10 L2) and daily tile (MOD10A1) products is ??93%, but varies by land-cover type and snow condition. The most frequent errors are due to snow/cloud discrimination problems, however, improvements in the MODIS cloud mask, an input product, have occurred in ?€?Collection 5?€? reprocessing. Detection of very thin snow (<1 cm thick) can also be problematic. Validation of MOD10 L2 and MOD10A1 applies to all higher-level products because all the higher-level products are all created from these products. The composited products may have larger errors due, in part, to errors propagated from daily products. Recently, new products have been developed. A fractional snow cover algorithm for the 500 m resolution products was developed, and is part of the C5 daily swath and tile products; a monthly CMG snow product at 0??05?? resolution and a daily 0??25?? resolution CMG snow product are also now available. Similar, but not identical products are also produced from the MODIS on the Aqua satellite, launched in May 2002, but the accuracy of those products has not yet been assessed in detail.

Acetaldehyde in the Alaskan subarctic snowpack,"Abstract. Acetaldehyde is a reactive intermediate in hydro- carbon oxidation. It is both emitted and taken up by snow- packs and photochemical and physical processes are proba- bly involved. Understanding the reactivity of acetaldehyde in snow and its processes of physical and chemical exchanges requires the knowledge of its incorporation mechanism in snow crystals. We have performed a season-long study of the evolution of acetaldehyde concentrations in the subarctic snowpack near Fairbanks (65??? N), central Alaska, which is subjected to a vigorous metamorphism due to persistent el- evated temperature gradients in the snowpack, between 20 and 200??? C m???1. The snowpack therefore almost entirely transforms into depth hoar. We have also analyzed acetalde- hyde in a manipulated snowpack where temperature gradi- ents were suppressed. Snow crystals there transformed much more slowly and their original shapes remained recognizable for months. The specific surface area of snow layers in both types of snowpacks was also measured. We deduce that ac- etaldehyde is not adsorbed onto the surface of snow crystals and that most of the acetaldehyde is probably not dissolved in the ice lattice of the snow crystals. We propose that most of the acetaldehyde measured is either trapped or dissolved within organic aerosol particles trapped in snow, or that ac- etaldehyde is formed by the hydrolysis of organic precursors contained in organic aerosols trapped in the snow, when the snow is melted for analysis. These precursors are probably aldehyde polymers formed within the aerosol particles by","For thermodynamic and kinetic calculations, and to fully un- derstand snowpack photochemistry and air-snow exchanges of reactive molecules, the location (and hence heterogeneous reactivity) of molecules detected in snow must be elucidated. By performing a season-long study of acetaldehyde concen- trations in snow, we conclude that acetaldehyde is not ad- sorbed onto snow crystal surfaces, and that it is for the most part probably not dissolved within snow crystals, whether at equilibrium or not. We are able to propose this conclusion",['Fairbanks']

Adjoint inversion modeling of Asian dust emission using lidar observations,"Abstract. A four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data as- similation system for a regional dust model (RAMS/CFORS- 4DVAR; RC4) is applied to an adjoint inversion of a heavy dust event over eastern Asia during 20 March?€?4 April 2007. The vertical profiles of the dust extinction coefficients de- rived from NIES Lidar network are directly assimilated, with validation using observation data. Two experiments assess impacts of observation site selection: Experiment A uses five Japanese observation sites located downwind of dust source regions; Experiment B uses these and two other sites near source regions. Assimilation improves the modeled dust ex- tinction coefficients. Experiment A and Experiment B as- similation results are mutually consistent, indicating that ob- servations of Experiment A distributed over Japan can pro- vide comprehensive information related to dust emission in- version. Time series data of dust AOT calculated using modeled and Lidar dust extinction coefficients improve the model results. At Seoul, Matsue, and Toyama, assimilation reduces the root mean square differences of dust AOT by 35?€?40%. However, at Beijing and Tsukuba, the RMS dif- ferences degrade because of fewer observations during the heavy dust event. Vertical profiles of the dust layer observed by CALIPSO are compared with assimilation results. The dense dust layer was trapped at potential temperatures (?? ) of 280?€?300 K and was higher toward the north; the model reproduces those characteristics well. Latitudinal distribu- tions of modeled dust AOT along the CALIPSO orbit paths agree well with those of CALIPSO dust AOT, OMI AI, and MODIS coarse-mode AOT, capturing the latitude at which AOTs and AI have high values.

Aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing in the high Himalaya based on measurements at the Nepal Climate ObservatoryPyramid site 5079 m asl,"Abstract. Intense anthropogenic emissions over the In- dian sub-continent lead to the formation of layers of par- ticulate pollution that can be transported to the high alti- tude regions of the Himalaya-Hindu-Kush (HKH). Aerosol particles contain a substantial fraction of strongly absorb- ing material, including black carbon (BC), organic com- pounds (OC), and dust all of which can contribute to atmo- spheric warming, in addition to greenhouse gases. Using a 3-year record of continuous measurements of aerosol optical properties, we present a time series of key climate relevant aerosol properties including the aerosol absorption (??ap) and scattering (??sp) coefficients as well as the single-scattering albedo (w0). Results of this investigation show substan- tial seasonal variability of these properties, with long range transport during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons and effi- cient precipitation scavenging of aerosol particles during the monsoon season. The monthly averaged scattering coeffi- cients range from 0.1 Mm???1 (monsoon) to 20 Mm???1 while the average absorption coefficients range from 0.5 Mm???1 to 3.5 Mm???1. Both have their maximum values during the pre- monsoon period (April) and reach a minimum during Mon- soon (July?€?August). This leads to dry w0 values from 0.86 (pre-monsoon) to 0.79 (monsoon) seasons. Significant di- urnal variability due to valley wind circulation is also re- ported.

Aerosols that form subvisible cirrus at the tropical tropopause,Abstract. The composition of residual particles from evap- orated cirrus ice crystals near the tropical tropopause as well as unfrozen aerosols were measured with a single particle mass spectrometer. Subvisible cirrus residuals were predom- inantly composed of internal mixtures of neutralized sulfate with organic material and were chemically indistinguishable from unfrozen sulfate-organic aerosols. Ice residuals were also similar in size to unfrozen aerosol. Heterogeneous ice nuclei such as mineral dust were not enhanced in these sub- visible cirrus residuals. Biomass burning particles were de- pleted in the residuals. Cloud probe measurements showing low cirrus ice crystal number concentrations were inconsis- tent with conventional homogeneous freezing. Recent lab- oratory studies provide heterogeneous nucleation scenarios that may explain tropopause level subvisible cirrus forma- tion.,,[]

Airsnowpack exchange of bromine ozone and mercury in the springtime Arctic simulated by the 1D model PHANTASPart 1 Insnow bromine activation and ,"To provide a theoretical framework towards better understanding of ozone depletion events (ODEs) and atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) in the polar bound- ary layer, we have developed a one-dimensional model that simulates multiphase chemistry and transport of trace constituents from porous snowpack and through the5 atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) as a unified system.

Albedo of dirty snow during conditions of melt,"Abstract. The evolution of spectrally averaged albedo (wavelengths between 0.28 mm and 2.8 mm) of snow surfaces treated with known initial concentrations of particles of submicron-sized soot and air fall volcanic ash was investigated during conditions of natural melt. Depending on the particle type and concentration, the initial applications reduced the surface albedo to values ranging from 0.18 to 0.41 which were substantially lower than the albedo of the untreated natural snow (about 0.61). Many of the soot particles flushed through the snowpack with the meltwater, and surface concentrations of soot greater than about 5 3 1027 kg/kg did not persist for more than a few days. The migration of particles to depth caused the snow to brighten after the initial application, thus limiting the amount of albedo reduction and the consequent effects on melting. Nevertheless, the soot remaining near the surface had a substantial, long-term effect. The residual concentration of 5 3 1027 kg/kg persisted for several weeks and, compared to the untreated surface, reduced the albedo by about 30% and increased melting by 50%. Particles of volcanic ash with diameters larger than about 5 mm remained at or near the snow surface. Although many of the smaller particles flushed through the snow with the meltwater, the surface albedo was not changed significantly by their removal. The different behaviors of the ash and soot are probably related to the difference in their particle size distributions in relation to the thickness of water films that form the transport paths under conditions of partial saturation that are characteristic of melting snow.","ash and soot can be attributed to differences in the mobility and the optical properties of particles. Ash particles larger than about 5 mm were relatively immobile during conditions of melt and the mass concentration of ash near the surface remained at or near original levels. Ash had a long-term influence on the albedo that increased with concentration. On the other hand, very high concentrations of submicron soot did not persist at the surface of coarse-grained, melting snow; the mass fraction of soot at the surface decreased to about 53 1027 kg/kg within three days because of downward migration of particles with the meltwater. The residual concentration near the surface ap- peared to be independent of the initial concentration of par- ticles. The migration of soot particles to depth caused the snow to brighten but even the reduced concentration of soot remain- ing near the surface had a long-term effect on albedo. The reduction in albedo (about 30% less than the natural snow) increased the ablation rate by about 50% during the experi- ments. The partial mobility of submicron-sized soot through melt-",[]

An AeroCom assessment of black carbon in Arctic snow and sea ice,"Though many global aerosols models prognose surface deposition, only a few models have been used to directly simulate the radiative effect from black carbon (BC) depo- sition to snow and sea-ice. Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and5 Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea-ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004?€?2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models gener-10 ally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distribu- tions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are ?€?4.4 (?€?13.2 to +10.7) ngg???1 for15 an earlier Phase of AeroCom models (Phase I), and +4.1 (?€?13.0 to +21.4) ngg???1 for a more recent Phase of AeroCom models (Phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ngg???1. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow in- clude Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sen-20 sitivity studies show that the model?€?measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non- melting snow. The Arctic (60?€?90??? N) atmospheric residence time for BC in Phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates25 from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07?€?0.25) Wm???2 and 0.18 (0.06?€?",,"['Russia', 'Arctic']"
An analysis of present and future seasonal northern hemisphere land snow cover simulated by CMIP5 coupled climate models,"Abstract. The 20th century seasonal Northern Hemisphere (NH) land snow cover as simulated by available CMIP5 model output is compared to observations. On average, the models reproduce the observed snow cover extent very well, but the significant trend towards a reduced spring snow cover extent over the 1979?€?2005 period is underes- timated (observed: (???3.4 ?? 1.1) % per decade; simulated: (???1.0 ?? 0.3) % per decade). We show that this is linked to the simulated Northern Hemisphere extratropical spring land warming trend over the same period, which is also under- estimated, although the models, on average, correctly cap- ture the observed global warming trend. There is a good linear correlation between the extent of hemispheric sea- sonal spring snow cover and boreal large-scale spring sur- face air temperature in the models, supported by available observations. This relationship also persists in the future and is independent of the particular anthropogenic climate forc- ing scenario. Similarly, the simulated linear relationship be- tween the hemispheric seasonal spring snow cover extent and global mean annual mean surface air temperature is stable in time. However, the slope of this relationship is underes- timated at present (observed: (???11.8 ?? 2.7) % ???C???1; simu- lated: (???5.1 ?? 3.0) % ???C???1) because the trend towards lower snow cover extent is underestimated, while the recent global warming trend is correctly represented.",,['Northern Hemisphere']

An intercomparison among four models of blowing snow,"Abstract. Four one-dimensional, time-dependent blowing snow models are intercompared. These include three spectral models, PIEKTUK-T, WINDBLAST, SNOWSTORM, and the bulk version of PIEKTUK-T, PIEKTUK-B. Although the four models are based on common physical concepts, they have been developed by different research groups. The structure of the models, numerical methods, meteorological field treatment and the parameterization schemes may be different. Under an agreed standard condition, the four models generally give similar results for the thermodynamic effects of blowing snow sublimation on the atmospheric boundary layer, including an increase of relative humidity and a decrease of the ambient temperature due to blowing snow sublimation. Relative humidity predicted by SNOWSTORM is lower than the predictions of the other models, which leads to a larger sublimation rate in SNOWSTORM. All four models demonstrate that sublimation rates in a column of blowing snow have a single maximum in time, illustrating self-limitation of the sublimation process of blowing snow. However, estimation of the eddy diffusion coefficient for momentum (Km), and thereby the diffusion coefficients for moisture (Kw) and for heat (Kh), has a significant influence on the process. Sensitivity tests with PIEKTUK-T show that the sublimation rate can be approximately constant with time after an initial phase, if Km is a linear function with height. In order to match the model results with blowing snow observations, some parameters in the standard run, such as settling velocity of blowing snow particles in these models, may need to be changed to more practical values.","Four one-dimensional, time-dependent, blowing snow models are intercompared. The models generally give similar results for most variables but some details of the bulk model predictions differ from those of the spectral models. The models give similar tendencies for most results. The models are sensitive to ambient factors such as initial temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and the particle size distribution in the saltation layer. Sensitivity tests for these were performed in D??ry et al. (1998). In addition to these factors, parameters such as eddy viscosity (Km) are very important. A linear Km for all height may not be appropriate for these models.",[]

Analytical and computational description of effect of grain size on yield stress of metals,"Abstract?€?Four principal factors contribute to grain-boundary strengthening: (a) the grain boundaries act as barriers to plastic flow; (b) the grain boundaries act as dislocation sources; (c) elastic anisotropy causes additional stresses in grain-boundary surroundings; (d) multislip is activated in the grain-boundary regions, whereas grain interiors are initially dominated by single slip, if properly oriented. As a result, the regions adjoining grain boundaries harden at a rate much higher than grain interiors. A phenomenological constitutive equation predicting the effect of grain size on the yield stress of metals is discussed and extended to the nanocrystalline regime. At large grain sizes, it has the Hall?€?Petch form, and in the nanocrystalline domain the slope gradually decreases until it asymptotically approaches the flow stress of the grain boundaries. The material is envisaged as a composite, comprised of the grain interior, with flow stress sfG, and grain boundary work-hardened layer, with flow stress sfGB. The predictions of this model are compared with experimental measurements over the mono, micro, and nanocrystalline domains. Computational predictions are made of plastic flow as a function of grain size incorporating differences of dislocation accumulation rate in grain- boundary regions and grain interiors. The material is modeled as a monocrystalline core surrounded by a mantle (grain-boundary region) with a high work hardening rate response. This is the first computational plasticity calculation that accounts for grain size effects in a physically-based manner. A discussion of statisti- cally stored and geometrically necessary dislocations in the framework of strain-gradient plasticity is intro- duced to describe these effects. Grain-boundary sliding in the nanocrystalline regime is predicted from calcu- lations using the Raj?€?Ashby model and incorporated into the computations; it is shown to predispose the material to shear localization. ??? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.",,[]

Asian dust outflow in the pbl and free atmosphere retrieved by NASA CALIPSO and an assimilated dust transport model,"Abstract. Three-dimensional structures of Asian dust trans- port in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free at- mosphere occurring successively during the end of May 2007 were clarified using results of space-borne backscat- ter lidar, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), and results obtained using a data-assimilated ver- sion of a dust transport model (RC4) based on a ground- based NIES lidar network. The dust layer depths and the vertical and horizontal structure simulated by RC4 agreed with those of CALIOP observations from the dust source re- gion to the far-downstream region. Two important transport mechanisms of Asian dust in the PBL and free atmosphere were clarified: a low-level dust outbreak within the dry slot region of a well-developed low-pressure system, and forma- tion of an elevated dust layer within the warm sector of a low-pressure system. We also represent the aging of pure dust particles using the particle depolarization ratio (PDR) at 532 nm and the color ratio (CR) at 1064 nm and 532 nm. Aerosols with high PDR were observed uniformly over the dust source region. While the dust cloud was transported to the eastern downwind regions, aerosols with low PDR and high CR occur in the layer of less than 1 km height, sug- gesting a mixing state of spherical aerosols and dust in the surface layer.","Detailed analyses incorporating the NASA space-borne lidar CALIOP, RC4 dust transport model, and the ground-based NIES lidar network clarified 3-D structures of Asian dust transport triggered by two subsequent low-pressure systems L1 and L2 during the end of May 2007.

As- similated results mitigated overestimation of dust concentra- tion by reducing 17.4% of dust emissions and improved the RMSD of dust AOT between the model and NIES lidar data by 31?€?67%.

Assessing recent measurement techniques for quantifying black carbon concentration in snow,"We evaluate the performance of the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and the Integrating Sphere/Integrating Sandwich Spectrophotometer (ISSW) in quantifying the concentration of refractory black carbon (BC) in snow samples. We find that the SP2 can be used to measure BC mass concentration in snow with substantially larger uncer-5 tainty (60 %) than for atmospheric sampling (<30 %). Achieving this level of accuracy requires careful assessment of nebulizer performance and SP2 calibration with con- sideration of the fact that BC in snow tends to larger sizes than typically observed in the atmosphere. Once these issues are addressed, the SP2 is able to measure the size distribution and mass concentration of BC in the snow. Laboratory comparison of10 the SP2 and the Integrating Sphere/Integrating Sandwich Spectrophotometer (ISSW) revealed significant biases in the estimate of BC concentration from the ISSW when test samples contained dust or non-absorbing particulates. These results suggest that current estimates of BC mass concentration in snow and ice using either the SP2 or the ISSW may be associated with significant underestimates of uncertainty.15","We find that BC in snow tends to be present at larger sizes than in the typical ambient atmosphere. This has implications for determinations of BC mass content in snow, as well as possible implications for our understanding of the roles of BC in affecting snow albedo and in evincing snow history. Due in part to the large sizes of BC observed25 in snow, use of the SP2 for BC-in-liquid measurements requires careful characteri- zation of nebulization efficiency as a function of particle size, as well, potentially, as",[]

Assimilating canopy reflectance data into an ecosystem model with an Ensemble Kalman Filter,"An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate canopy reflectance data into an ecosystem model. We demonstrate the use of an augmented state vector approach to enable a canopy reflectance model to be used as a non-linear observation operator. A key feature of data assimilation (DA) schemes, such as the EnKF, is that they incorporate information on uncertainty in both the model and the observations to provide a best estimate of the true state of a system. In addition, estimates of uncertainty in the model outputs (given the observed data) are calculated, which is crucial in assessing the utility of model predictions.","This paper aims to assess the feasibility of the assimilation of canopy BRF data into the simple ecosystem model, DALEC as an aid to improving spatial estimates of C fluxes and pools. The study has shown the approach to be feasible and can be considered successful in many respects, in particular in developing and linking the theory and tools required to allow assimilation of moderate resolution BRF data from MODIS into an ecosystem model through the use of an ensemble scheme with an augmented state vector allowing the treatment of a non- linear observation operator. It has also been demonstrated that BRF model inversion allows a practical method for the estimation of ?€?ancillary?€? parameters (those not directly linked to ecosystem model parameters) required by the observation operator. Although the ensuing parameters are derived from a simplistic assumption that they are constant over a three year period, a mechanism has been included to allow for uncertainty in these terms to be incorporated into the estimation of model error.",[]

Atmospheric aerosol compositions in China spatialtemporal variability chemical signature regional haze distribution and comparisons with global aerosols,"Abstract. From 2006 to 2007, the daily concentrations of major inorganic water-soluble constituents, mineral aerosol, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in ambi- ent PM10 samples were investigated from 16 urban, rural and remote sites in various regions of China, and were com- pared with global aerosol measurements. A large difference between urban and rural chemical species was found, nor- mally with 1.5 to 2.5 factors higher in urban than in rural sites. Optically-scattering aerosols, such as sulfate (???16 %), OC (???15 %), nitrate (???7 %), ammonium (???5 %) and min- eral aerosol (???35 %) in most circumstance, are majorities of the total aerosols, indicating a dominant scattering fea- ture of aerosols in China. Of the total OC, ???55 %?€?60 % can be attributed to the formation of the secondary organic carbon (SOC). The absorbing aerosol EC only accounts for ???3.5 % of the total PM10. Seasonally, maximum concen- trations of most aerosol species were found in winter while mineral aerosol peaks in spring. In addition to the regular seasonal maximum, secondary peaks were found for sulfate and ammonium in summer and for OC and EC in May and June. This can be considered as a typical seasonal pattern in various aerosol components in China. Aerosol acidity was normally neutral in most of urban areas, but becomes some acidic in rural areas. Based on the surface visibility obser- vations from 681 meteorological stations in China between 1957 and 2005, four major haze areas are identified with sim- ilar visibility changes, namely, (1) Hua Bei Plain in N.

We describe and evaluate the NMMB/BSC-Dust, a new dust aerosol cycle model embedded online within the NCEP Non-hydrostatic Multiscale Model (NMMB). NMMB is a further evolution of the operational Non- hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM), which together with other upgrades has been extended from meso to global scales.

An Atmospheric Mercury (Hg) Depletion Event (AMDE) was observed from themorning of April 24 until the evening of April 27. Transport of already Hg and ozone (O3) depleted air masses could explain this observed depletion. Due to a snowfall event during the AMDE, surface snow Hg concentrations increased two fold. Hg deposition took place over a short period of time corresponding to 3?€?4 days. More than 80% of the deposited Hg was estimated to be reemitted back to the atmosphere in the days following the event. During the campaign, we observed night and day variations in surface snow Hg concentrations, which may be the result of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) oxidation to divalent Hg at the snow/air interface by daylight surface snow chemistry. Finally, a decrease in the reactive Hg (HgR) fraction of total Hg (HgT) in the surface snow was observed during spring. We postulate that the transformation of HgR to a more stable form may occur in Arctic snow during spring.",,"['Arctic', 'NyAlesund Svalbard', 'Ny-??lesund']"

Automated delineation of dry and melt snow zones in Antarctica using active and passive microwave observations from space,"Abstract?€?This paper presents the algorithms and analysis re- sults for delineating snow zones using active and passive mi- crowave satellite remote sensing data. With a high-resolution Radarsat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image mosaic, dry snow zones, percolation zones, wet snow zones, and blue ice patches for the Antarctic continent have been successfully delineated. A competing region growing and merging algorithm is used to initially segment the SAR images into a series of homogeneous regions. Based on the backscatter characteristics and texture property, these image regions are classified into different snow zones. The higher level of knowledge about the areal size of and adjacency relationship between snow zones is incorporated into the algorithms to correct classification errors caused by the SAR image noise and relief-induced radiometric distortions. Mathe- matical morphology operations and a line-tracing algorithm are designed to extract a vector line representation of snow-zone boundaries. With the daily passive microwave Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data, dry and melt snow zones were derived using a multiscale wavelet-transform-based method. The analysis results respectively derived from Radarsat SAR and SSM/I data were compared and correlated. The complementary nature and comparative advantages of frequently repeated passive microwave data and spatially detailed radar imagery for detecting and characterizing snow zones were demonstrated.",,"['Antarctic', 'Antarctica']"
Autonomous Aerial Vehicles AAVs as a Tool for Improving the Spatial Resolution of Snow Albedo Measurements in Mountainous Regions,"Abstract: We present technical advances and methods to measure effective broadband physical albedo in snowy mountain headwaters using a prototype dual-sensor pyranometer mounted on an Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (an AAV). Our test flights over snowy meadows and forested areas performed well during both clear sky and snowy/windy conditions at an elevation of ~2650 m above mean sea level (MSL). Our AAV-pyranometer platform provided high spatial (m) and temporal resolution (sec) measurements of effective broadband (310?€?2700 nm) surface albedo. The AAV-based measurements reveal spatially explicit changes in landscape albedo that are not present in concurrent satellite measurements from Landsat and MODIS due to a higher spatial resolution. This AAV capability is needed for validation of satellite snow albedo products, especially over variable montane landscapes at spatial scales of critical importance to hydrological applications. Effectively measuring albedo is important, as annually the seasonal accumulation and melt of mountain snowpack represent a dramatic transformation of Earth?€?s albedo, which directly affects headwaters?€? water and energy cycles.","The advances we present in measuring albedo from an AAV improve scientific capacity, and subsequent efforts in the lab and field will improve the robustness of the platform and its measurements. Our measurements readily encapsulate the spatial variability of albedo across landscapes that is not discernable in coarser resolution satellite data. Our efforts should be interpreted as a first stage to directly address the timely, complex challenge of improved measurements and models of albedo [13]. These improvements will facilitate workflows to measure albedo at the hillslope and small watershed scale, greatly expanding from the current status quo of point-based measurements and broad scale remote sensing. These insights will provide better data for more geographically focused energy and water balance simulations, critical for improved hydrological modelling. Additionally, subsequent data from AAVs present great opportunities to augment space-borne calibration and validation measurements. These new data will not be tethered to a fixed location and have the inherent capacity to measure across rugged and hazardous terrain. While this study focuses on 11 ha total, this approach could easily be scaled and flown in other snowy mountains across the Earth.",[]

Azimuth variation in microwave scatterometer and radiometer data over Antarctica,"Abstract?€?While designed for ocean observation, scatterometer and radiometer data have proven very useful in a variety of cryosphere studies. Over large regions of Antarctica, ice sheet and bedrock topography and the snow deposition, drift, and erosional environment combine to produce roughness on various scales. Roughness ranges from broad, basin-scale ice-sheet topog- raphy at 100 km wavelengths to large, spatially coherent dune fields at 10 km wavelength to erosional features on the meter scale known as sastrugi. These roughness scales influence the microwave backscattering and emission properties of the surface, combining to introduce azimuth-angle dependencies in the satel- lite observation data. In this paper, we explore the use of NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) data, European remote sensing (ERS) advanced microwave instrument (AMI) scatterometer mode data, and special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) data to study surface roughness effects in Antarctica. All three sensors provide strong evidence of azimuth modulation, which is correlated with the surface slope environment and results in a katabatic wind flow regime. Due to its broad azimuth coverage, NSCAT data appears to be the best suited for azimuth-angle observations. A simple empirical model for the azimuth variation in the radar backscatter is developed, and an algorithm for computing the parameters of the model from NSCAT data at a fine scale is presented. Results indicate relationships exist between the azimuthal variation of the data and the orientation of the surface slope and small-scale roughness relative to the sensor-look direction.",,['Antarctica']

Four different communities and one culture of au- totrophic microbial assemblages were obtained by incuba- tion of samples collected from high elevation snow in the Alps (Mt.

Molecular analysis of more than 200 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that all cultured cells belong to the Bacteria domain. Phylogenetic comparison with the currently available rDNA database al- lowed sequences belonging to Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria) , Actinobacteria and Bac- teroidetes phyla to be identified. The Andes snow culture was the richest in bacterial diversity (eight microorganisms identified) and the marine Antarctic soil the poorest (only one). Snow samples from Col du Midi (Alps) and the An- des shared the highest number of identified microorganisms (Agrobacterium, Limnobacter, Aquiflexus and two uncul- tured Alphaproteobacteria clones). These two sampling sites also shared four sequences with the Antarctic aerosol sample (Limnobacter, Pseudonocardia and an uncultured Alphapro- teobacteria clone). The only microorganism identified in the Antarctica soil (Brevundimonas sp.) was also detected in the Antarctic aerosol. Most of the identified microorganisms had been detected previously in cold environments, marine sedi- ments soils and rocks. Air current dispersal is the best model to explain the presence of very specific microorganisms, like those identified in this work, in environments very distant and very different from each other.",,"['Antarctic Alpine', 'Actinobacteria', 'Antarctica', 'Antarctic', 'Andes', 'Uruguay']"

Planktonic bacterial communities in Toolik Lake, Alaska, are composed of persistent populations and transient populations. Most transient populations can be di- vided into those that are advected by snow meltwater into the upper water column of the lake below the ice in spring and those that grow up from low concentrations in response to the development of the phytoplankton community in early sum- mer. Advected bacteria are probably responsible for high levels of bacterial production below the ice in early spring, consum- ing labile organic matter carried off the tundra and into the lake by snow meltwater. A different community of bacteria is responsible for bacterial production after ice leaves the lake, likely consuming organic matter released by phytoplankton.

Ballast minerals and the sinking carbon flux in the ocean carbonspecific respiration rates and sinking velocity of marine snow aggregates,"Abstract. Recent observations have shown that fluxes of bal- last minerals (calcium carbonate, opal, and lithogenic mate- rial) and organic carbon fluxes are closely correlated in the bathypelagic zones of the ocean. Hence it has been hypoth- esized that incorporation of biogenic minerals within ma- rine aggregates could either protect the organic matter from decomposition and/or increase the sinking velocity via bal- lasting of the aggregates. Here we present the first com- bined data on size, sinking velocity, carbon-specific respi- ration rate, and composition measured directly in three ag- gregate types; Emiliania huxleyi aggregates (carbonate bal- lasted), Skeletonema costatum aggregates (opal ballasted), and aggregates made from a mix of both E. huxleyi and S. costatum (carbonate and opal ballasted). Overall average carbon-specific respiration rate was ???0.13 d???1 and did not vary with aggregate type and size. Ballasting from carbon- ate resulted in 2- to 2.5-fold higher sinking velocities than those of aggregates ballasted by opal. We compiled litera- ture data on carbon-specific respiration rate and sinking ve- locity measured in aggregates of different composition and sources. Compiled carbon-specific respiration rates (includ- ing this study) vary between 0.08 d???1 and 0.20 d???1. Sink- ing velocity increases with increasing aggregate size within homogeneous sources of aggregates. When compared across different particle and aggregate sources, however, sinking ve- locity appeared to be independent of particle or aggregate",,[]

Biological and physical influences on marine snowfall at the equator,,"Conclusions Our results suggest that gut flux via diel vertical migration creates a strong deviation of particle flux from the often-assumed power- law function for particle flux38, shuttling particulate matter to the mesopelagic layer and thereby enhancing particulate matter flux to the bathypelagic. Contrary to model assumptions that assign bathypelagic particle flux to large, fast sinking particles39?€?42, we observe that bathypelagic particle flux is mainly maintained by an almost constant flux of rather small particles down to >4,000m depth. The poleward dispersion of this veil of particles is prevented by a high gradient of potential vorticity of the deep equatorial jets. Zooplankton diel vertical migrations, particulate matter disintegration, and the intermediate and deep equatorial currents seem key in the generation and maintenance of marine equatorial snowfall and for carbon sequestration in the deep ocean.",[]

Biooptical characteristics of the snow ice and water column of a perennially icecovered lake in the High Arctic,"Abstract: Lake A is a meromictic, perennially ice-covered lake located at the northern limit of North America (latitude 83??N, Ellesmere Island, Canada). In early June 1999, only 0.45% of incident photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) was transmitted through its 2-m ice and 0.5-m snow cover. Removal of snow from 12 m2 increased PAR under the ice by a factor of 13 and biologically effective ultraviolet radiation (UVR) by a factor of 16 (from 0.4% to 6.3% of incident). The diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) for UVR was substantially lower in the ice than in the underlying freshwater (e.g., 50% lower at 320 nm), indicating the exclusion of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) during freeze-up or the subsequent degradation of CDOM retained in the ice. Peak phytoplankton concentrations occurred immediately under the ice, and a broad maximum of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria and associated sulfur particles was observed over the depth interval 20?€?45 m at <0.005% of incident PAR. Climate-induced changes in the overlying snow and ice have the potential to cause major habitat disruption (UV exposure, PAR, temperature, mixing regime) for these stratified, extreme-shade communities.",,['North America']

Black carbon aerosols and the third polar ice cap,"Abstract. Recent thinning of glaciers over the Himalayas (sometimes referred to as the third polar region) have raised concern on future water supplies since these glaciers supply water to large river systems that support millions of peo- ple inhabiting the surrounding areas. Black carbon (BC) aerosols, released from incomplete combustion, have been increasingly implicated as causing large changes in the hy- drology and radiative forcing over Asia and its deposition on snow is thought to increase snow melt. In India BC emis- sions from biofuel combustion is highly prevalent and com- pared to other regions, BC aerosol amounts are high. Here, we quantify the impact of BC aerosols on snow cover and precipitation from 1990 to 2010 over the Indian subcontinen- tal region using two different BC emission inventories. New estimates indicate that Indian BC emissions from coal and biofuel are large and transport is expected to expand rapidly in coming years. We show that over the Himalayas, from 1990 to 2000, simulated snow/ice cover decreases by ???0.9% due to aerosols. The contribution of the enhanced Indian BC to this decline is ???36%, similar to that simulated for 2000 to 2010. Spatial patterns of modeled changes in snow cover and precipitation are similar to observations (from 1990 to 2000), and are mainly obtained with the newer BC estimates.","Although we do not preclude the influence of large-scale cir- culation or GHGs on the spatial patterns of precipitation or snow cover changes, our results indicate that aerosols and the enhanced Indian fossil/bio-fuel BC aerosols in particu- lar may be responsible for some of the observed patterns and trends in snow/ice cover and precipitation. However, since we use prescribed SSTs in our simulations the climate response we simulate for the monsoon, especially near the ocean, may not fully account for feedbacks that occur when aerosols impact SSTs that could affect the spatial pattern of precipitation (Rotstayn and Lohmann, 2002). The range in climate impacts from the two emission inventories ex- amined provide an estimate of the expected uncertainty in climate change from aerosols for the last decade (1990 to 2000) and illustrate future expected challenges from aerosols and BC emissions in particular. Preserving the present snow/ice cover on the third polar ice cap would require con- certed efforts to reduce both GHGs and BC emissions from coal as well as transportation and residential cooking/heating sources.","['Asia', 'India']"

Black Carbon Aerosols in Arctic Snow and Implications for Albedo Change,"Abstract: since vast snow and ice fields of the Earth?€?s cryosphere have been recognized as habitats for different organisms, life in ice is no longer a paradox. According to the latest trend in cryo-research, cryoconites are now seen as micro-ecosystems with high ecological relevance for glaciers worldwide. In alpine glaciers cryoconites are often found to contain rather high concentrations of radioactive remnants from atmospheric atomic bomb tests and the Chernobyl accident, suggesting a distinct microbial community capable to cope with higher radioactive doses as usual. GLIMCOs (glacier ice microbial communities) seem to be relevant for the formation of cryoconites and, thus, determine the chemical milieu which in turn is responsible for the efficient accumulation, retention and release of radionuclides and other pol- lutants. Therefore, an investigation of the functional biodiversity of GLIMCOS is crucial for the study of nutrient fluxes and accumulation, absorption and biological uptake of fallout com- pounds in glaciers. Since glaciers are retreating worldwide the accumulated radionuclides may be washed out within a short time, thus a better understanding of the processes involved in storage and release of radionuclides are urgently needed. On the other hand, radioactive trac- ers may help to recognize the dynamics of origin and transformation of cryoconites and pos- sibly their erosion, ablation and weathering. A more detailed study will follow this preliminary description of scenarios.","Here we have presented a summary of a five years long observation series of airborne 210Pb at the Mt. Zeppelin Global Atmosphere Watch station, Svalbard. In winter the 210Pb activity concentrations found in Svalbard are comparable to those found in Finland. In summer, however, the concentrations are much lower than in continental areas. An air mass tra- jectory analysis indicated that in summer 210Pb can be used as a tracer for air masses having a contact to land areas within past five days. In winter this cannot be done due to the Arctic haze type accumulation of 210Pb-carrying aerosol particles into the atmosphere. But even in winter a low 210Pb activity concentration indicates that the associated air mass has had little if any contact with land areas. Owing to the International Polar Year 2007/2008 the measurement programme will be expanded to 210Po and 7Be. These measurements are expected to bring new informa- tion concerning aerosol particle residence time and vertical movement of the air in the High Arctic.","['Svalbard', 'Chernobyl', 'Mt.

Black carbon decomposition and incorporation into soil microbial biomass estimated by 14C labeling,,"Direct estimation of BC decomposition in soil under optimal conditions showed very slow rates of about 1.36 10???5 d???1, corre- sponding to a decomposition of about 0.5% BC per year. Considering the much slower decomposition under field conditions, we esti- mated the mean residence time of BC in soils of temperate climates to be about 2000 years. Glucose amendment as a C and energy substrate for microorganisms strongly stimulated BC decomposi- tion. However, this stimulation was strongly pronounced for the first week and lasted maximum one month. Both results indicated that BC decomposition mainly involved cometabolism. Intensive soil mixing had a smaller and shorter stimulation effect. We explain this mainly by the release of additional substrate on new aggregate surfaces. The incorporation of BC in microorganisms varied between 1.5 and 2.6% of BC input, confirming our hypothesis on cometabolic BC decomposition by microorganisms. As the amount of BC in dissolved organic carbon was below the detection limit, no contamination of ground water by BC decomposition products can be expected.",[]
Black carbon in snow in the upper Himalayan Khumbu Valley Nepal observations and modeling of the impact on snow albedo melting and radiative forcing,"Black carbon (BC) in the snow in the Himalayas has recently attracted considerable interest due to its impact on snow albedo, snow and glacier melting, regional climate and water resources. A single particle soot photometer (SP2) instrument was used to measure refractory BC (rBC) in a series of surface snow samples collected in the upper5 Khumbu Valley in Nepal between November 2009 and February 2012. The obtained time series indicates annual cycles with maximum concentration before the onset of the monsoon season and fast decreases in rBC during the monsoon period. Measured concentrations ranged from a few ppb up to 70 ppb rBC. However, due to the handling of the samples the measured concentrations possess rather large uncertainties. De-10 tailed modeling of the snowpack including the measured range and an estimated upper limit of rBC concentrations was performed to study the role of BC in the seasonal snow- pack. Simulations were performed for three winter seasons with the snowpack model Crocus including a detailed description of the radiative transfer inside the snowpack. While the standard Crocus model strongly overestimates the height and the duration of15 the seasonal snowpack, a better calculation of the snow albedo with the new radiative transfer scheme enhanced the representation of the snow. However, the period with snow on the ground neglecting BC in the snow was still over-estimated between 37 and 66 days, which was further diminished by 8 to 15 % and more than 40 % in the presence of 100 or 300 ppb of BC. Compared to snow without BC the albedo is on20 average reduced by 0.027 and 0.060 in the presence of 100 and 300 ppb BC. While the impact of increasing BC in the snow on the albedo was largest for clean snow, the impact on the local radiative forcing is the opposite. Here, increasing BC caused an even larger impact at higher BC concentrations. This effect is related to an acceler- ated melting of the snowpack caused by a more efficient metamorphism of the snow25 due to an increasing size of the snow grains with increasing BC concentrations. The melting of the winter snowpack was shifted by 3 to 10 days and 17 to 27 days during the three winter seasons in the presence of 100 and 300 ppb BC compared to clean","The here reported time series of rBC concentrations in the surface snow in the upper Khumbu valley indicates a seasonal cycle with maximum concentrations in the pre-10 monsoon period and low concentrations during the monsoon period. This cycle directly reflects the behavior of atmospheric BC in the same high altitude region (Marinoni et al., 2010) and is also conserved in ice cores from near-by glaciers (Ginot et al., 2014). Therefore, ice cores can be used to re-construct historic BC concentrations in these regions. Unfortunately, a large uncertainty remains regarding the absolute BC15 in snow concentrations. While the SP2 technique delivers precise concentrations of rBC, the melting of the snow samples during transport and storage potentially modified the detected concentrations. This effect probably contributed to discrepancies between the here reported snow concentrations compared to previously reported results for EC, while the two different techniques also add to the mismatch (Lim et al., 2014). Further20 measurements are needed to resolve these discrepancies and to determine actual concentrations. Such accurate data are urgently needed for the validation of global and regional models used to calculate the impact of BC in snow on the regional climate (Qian et al., 2011; M??n??goz et al., 2014). While models simulating the impact of BC in snow on albedo and radiative forcing for a given snowpack exists, the quantification is25 currently mostly hampered by the uncertainty in BC in snow concentrations.","['Khumbu valley', 'Valley Nepal', 'Himalayan Khumbu Valley Nepal', 'Khumbu Valley', 'Nepal', 'Himalayas', 'Khumbu Valley Nepal']"
Black carbon in the Arctic the underestimated role of gas flaring and residential combustion emissions,"Abstract. Arctic haze is a seasonal phenomenon with high concentrations of accumulation-mode aerosols occurring in the Arctic in winter and early spring. Chemistry transport models and climate chemistry models struggle to reproduce this phenomenon, and this has recently prompted changes in aerosol removal schemes to remedy the modeling problems. In this paper, we show that shortcomings in current emis- sion data sets are at least as important. We perform a 3 yr model simulation of black carbon (BC) with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART. The model is driven with a new emission data set (?€?ECLIPSE emissions?€?) which includes emissions from gas flaring. While gas flaring is es- timated to contribute less than 3 % of global BC emissions in this data set, flaring dominates the estimated BC emissions in the Arctic (north of 66??? N). Putting these emissions into our model, we find that flaring contributes 42 % to the annual mean BC surface concentrations in the Arctic. In March, flar- ing even accounts for 52 % of all Arctic BC near the surface. Most of the flaring BC remains close to the surface in the Arctic, so that the flaring contribution to BC in the middle and upper troposphere is small. Another important factor de- termining simulated BC concentrations is the seasonal varia- tion of BC emissions from residential combustion (often also called domestic combustion, which is used synonymously in this paper). We have calculated daily residential combustion emissions using the heating degree day (HDD) concept based on ambient air temperature and compare results from model simulations using emissions with daily, monthly and annual time resolution. In January, the Arctic-mean surface concen-","BC emissions from gas flaring are less than 3 % of global BC emissions in the ECLIPSE emission data set but they dominate the BC emissions in the Arctic (latitudes greater than 66??? N). Using these emissions for simulations with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, we find that the flaring emissions contribute 42 % to the annual mean BC surface concentrations in the Arctic. Their contribution is largest in March when they account for 52 % of all Arctic BC near the surface. Most of the flaring BC in the Arctic re- sides close to the surface, so that the contribution of flaring emissions in the middle and upper troposphere is small.",['Arctic']
Black carbon in the atmosphere and snow from preindustrial times until present,"Abstract. The distribution of black carbon (BC) in the at- mosphere and the deposition of BC on snow surfaces since pre-industrial time until present are modelled with the Oslo CTM2 model. The model results are compared with obser- vations including recent measurements of BC in snow in the Arctic. The global mean burden of BC from fossil fuel and biofuel sources increased during two periods. The first pe- riod, until 1920, is related to increases in emissions in North America and Europe, and the last period after 1970 are re- lated mainly to increasing emissions in East Asia. Although the global burden of BC from fossil fuel and biofuel in- creases, in the Arctic the maximum atmospheric BC burden as well as in the snow was reached in 1960s, with a slight reduction thereafter. The global mean burden of BC from open biomass burning sources has not changed significantly since 1900. With current inventories of emissions from open biomass sources, the modelled burden of BC in snow and in the atmosphere north of 65??? N is small compared to the BC burden of fossil fuel and biofuel origin. From the concen- tration changes radiative forcing time series due to the direct aerosol effect as well as the snow-albedo effect is calculated for BC from fossil fuel and biofuel. The calculated radiative forcing in 2000 for the direct aerosol effect is 0.35 W m???2","The transport of BC in the atmosphere and the deposition of BC on snow surfaces since pre-industrial times have been modelled with the Oslo CTM2 model. From these model results radiative forcing histories for both the direct aerosol effect and snow albedo effect of BC from fossil fuel and biofuel sources are calculated. The modelled global mean radiative forcing of the direct aerosol effect of FFBF BC is 0.35 W m???2 and the snow albedo effect 0.016 W m???2 in year 2000, relative to pre-industrial times. A formal error propagation analysis is difficult to perform. Related to the ranges given in the IPCC AR4 (Forster et al., 2007), our re- sults for the direct aerosol effect is in the higher range [0.05?€? 0.35 W m???2] and for the snow albedo effect in the lower range [0?€?0.2 W m???2] given by the IPCC.","['North America', 'Arctic', 'Oslo']"
Black carbon or brown carbon The nature of lightabsorbing carbonaceous aerosols,"Although the definition and measurement methods of atmospheric ?€?black carbon?€? (?€?BC?€?) have long been subjects of scientific controversy, the recent discovery of light- absorbing carbon that is not black (?€?brown carbon, Cbrown?€?) makes it imperative to re- assess and redefine the components that make up light-absorbing carbonaceous mat-5 ter (LAC) in the atmosphere. Evidence for the atmospheric presence of Cbrown comes directly from aerosol absorption measurements near specific combustion sources, from observations of spectral properties of water extracts of continental aerosol, from lab- oratory studies indicating the formation of light-absorbing organic matter in the atmo- sphere, and indirectly from the chemical analogy of aerosol species to colored natural10 humic substances. We show that these species may severely bias measurements of ?€?BC?€? and ?€?EC?€? over vast parts of the troposphere, where mass concentration of Cbrown is high relative to that of combustion soot. We also imply that due to the strongly skewed absorption of Cbrown towards the UV, single-wavelength light absorption mea- surements may not be adequate for the assessment of absorption of solar radiation in15 the troposphere. The possible consequences of these effects on our understanding of tropospheric processes are discussed.","The recent discovery of brown carbon in atmospheric aerosol makes it necessary to revisit the concept of a light-absorbing carbonaceous (LAC) component of atmospheric aerosol, which has been traditionally assumed to be exclusively black combustion soot.20 Although soot particles are readily recognizable by their typical morphologies, they are far from being uniform either in their chemical or physical properties. Unfortunately, monitoring methods that are commonly used for the determination of the mass con- centration of soot carbon can only provide operationally defined quantities such as black carbon (?€?BC?€?) or elemental carbon (?€?EC?€?). However, the operational character of25 these analytical parameters is very often overlooked, it would therefore be highly de- sirable to indicate it through the use of terms like ?€?apparent EC?€?

Black carbon record based on a shallow Himalayan ice core and its climatic implications,"Abstract. A continuous measurement for black carbon (hereafter ?€?BC?€?) in a 40 m shallow ice core retrieved from the East Rongbuk Glacier (hereafter ?€?ERG?€?) in the northeast saddle of Mt. Qomolangma (Everest) provided the first his- torical record of BC deposition during the past ???50 yrs in the high Himalyas. Apparent increasing trend (smooth aver- age) of BC concentrations was revealed since the mid-1990s. Seasonal variability of BC concentrations in the ice core in- dicated higher concentrations in monsoon seasons than those in non-monsoon seasons. Backward air trajectory analy- sis by the HYSPLIT model indicated that South Asia?€?s BC emissions had significant impacts on the BC deposition in the Mt. Qomolangma (Everest) region. The estimated aver- age atmospheric BC concentration in the region was about 80 ng m???3 during 1951?€?2001.

It was suggested that this amplitudes of BC concentrations in the atmosphere over the Himalayas and consequently in the ice in the glaciers could not be neglected when assessing the dual warming effects on glacier melting in the Himalayas.","BC concentrations were continuously measured based on a 50-year ice core (ERIC2002C) retrieved from the ERG in the northeast saddle of Mt.

The general varying trend of BC concentrations indicated a significant increase since the mid-1990s, and the seasonal cycles of BC concen- trations suggested BC concentration level in monsoon sea- sons was higher than that in non-monsoon seasons. The es- timated atmospheric BC concentrations over the ERG dur- ing the past 50 yrs showed similar varying trend with that in ice, and the average was about 80 ng m???3.

Black carbon semidirect effects on cloud cover review and synthesis,"Abstract. Absorbing aerosols (AAs) such as black car- bon (BC) or dust absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. Previous studies have described conditions un- der which AAs either increase or decrease cloud cover. The effect depends on several factors, including the altitude of the AA relative to the cloud and the cloud type. We at- tempt to categorize the effects into several likely regimes. Cloud cover is decreased if the AAs are embedded in the cloud layer. AAs below cloud may enhance convection and cloud cover. AAs above cloud top stabilize the underlying layer and tend to enhance stratocumulus clouds but may re- duce cumulus clouds. AAs can also promote cloud cover in convergent regions as they enhance deep convection and low level convergence as it draws in moisture from ocean to land regions. Most global model studies indicate a regional variation in the cloud response but generally increased cloud cover over oceans and some land regions, with net increased low-level and/or reduced upper level cloud cover. The result is a net negative semi-direct effect feedback from the cloud response to AAs. In some of these climate model studies, the cooling effect of BC due to cloud changes is strong enough to essentially cancel the warming direct effects.",,[]

BRDF models to predict spectral reflectance and emissivity in the thermal infrared,"Abstract?€?This paper presents modifications to the linear ker- nel bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models from Roujean et al. and from Wanner et al. that extend the spectral range into the thermal infrared (TIR). Our application is to synthesize the TIR optical properties of a scene pixel from laboratory component measurements. The angular reflectance and emissivity are needed to convert the radiance of a pixel as measured from space to land-surface temperature. The kernel models will be applied to develop a look-up table for the MODIS land-surface temperature algorithm to estimate the spectral, angular scene emissivity from land cover classification. A shrub scene and a dense canopy scene illustrate qualitative differences in angular emissivity that would not be evident without the kernel model modifications. We conclude that the modified models pro- vide a simple and efficient way to estimate scene optical properties over a wide spectral range.",,[]

Burialnutrient feedbacks amplify the sensitivity of atmospheric carbon dioxide to changes in organic matter remineralisation,"Abstract. Changes in the marine remineralisation of particulate organic matter (POM) and calcium carbonate potentially provide a positive feedback with atmospheric CO2 and climate change. The responses to changes in remineralisation length scales are systematically mapped with the Bern3D ocean?€?sediment model for atmo- spheric CO2 and tracer fields for which observations and palaeoproxies exist. Results show that the ?€?sediment burial-nutrient feedback?€? amplifies the response in atmospheric CO2 by a factor of four to seven. A transient imbalance between the weathering flux and the burial of organic matter and calcium carbonate lead to sustained changes in the ocean?€?s phosphate and alkalinity inventory and in turn in surface nutrient availability, marine pro- ductivity, and atmospheric CO2. It takes decades to centuries to reorganise tracers and fluxes within the ocean, many millennia to approach equilibrium for burial fluxes, while ??13C signatures are still changing 200 000 years after the perturbation. At 1.7 ppm m???1, atmospheric CO2 sensitivity is about fifty times larger for a unit change in the remineralisation depth of POM than of calcium carbonate. The results highlight the role of organic matter burial in atmospheric CO2 and the substantial impacts of seemingly small changes in POM remineralisation.",,[]

Carbon and nitrogen cycling in snowcovered environments,"The last two decades have seen significant advances in understanding the cycling of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems characterized by seasonal snow cover. This paper reviews and summarizes work on the interactions between seasonal snow cover, soil physico-chemical characteristics, bio- logical activity, and plot- to ecosystem-scale carbon and nitrogen cycling. The magnitude of win- ter biogeochemical activity is considerable. For example, including these winter fluxes into annual estimates of net ecosystem exchange reduces annual carbon uptake by 50% or more in many eco- systems. The primary climatic control on these fluxes is the amount and timing of precipitation, especially the formation of a consistent seasonal snow cover. Consistent snow cover limits frost damage and controls both the timing and amount of liquid water in soil and the availability of labile carbon substrates. Together, liquid water and labile carbon control the magnitude of in situ activity, exchanges of CO2 and trace gases, and export of dissolved nutrients. The importance of snow cover to biogeochemical fluxes has led a renewed interest in how spatial variability in vege- tation structure influences snow cover through shading, wind sheltering, and interception. Changes in snow cover associated with ongoing changes in both temperature and precipitation have the potential to profoundly impact the soil environment during winter and spring with unclear effects on annual and longer-term patterns of carbon and nitrogen cycling.",,[]

Centennial black carbon turnover observed in a Russian steppe soil,"Abstract. Black carbon (BC), from incomplete combustion of fuels and biomass, has been considered highly recalci- trant and a substantial sink for carbon dioxide. Recent stud- ies have shown that BC can be degraded in soils. We use two soils with very low spatial variability sampled 100 years apart in a Russian steppe preserve to generate the first whole- profile estimate of BC stocks and turnover in the field. Quan- tities of fire residues in soil changed significantly over a cen- tury. Black carbon stock was 2.5 kg m???2, or about 7?€?10% of total organic C in 1900. With cessation of biomass burn- ing, BC stocks decreased 25% over a century, which trans- lates into a centennial soil BC turnover (293 years best esti- mate; range 182?€?541 years), much faster than so-called inert or passive carbon in ecosystem models. The turnover time presented here is for loss by all processes, namely decompo- sition, leaching, and erosion, although the latter two were probably insignificant in this case. Notably, at both time points, the peak BC stock was below 30 cm, a depth inter- val, which is not typically accounted for. Also, the quality of the fire residues changed with time, as indicated by the use benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) as molecular mark- ers. The proportions of less-condensed (and thus more eas- ily degradable) BC structures decreased, whereas the highly condensed (and more recalcitrant) BC structures survived un- changed over the 100-year period. Our results show that BC cannot be assumed chemically recalcitrant in all soils, and other explanations for very old soil carbon are needed.",In this study we generated the first whole-profile estimate of BC stocks and turnover in the field by using soils sampled 100 years apart in a Russian steppe preserve.

Changes in seasonal snow cover in Hindu KushHimalayan region,"The changes in seasonal snow covered area in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region have been examined using Moderate ?€? resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day standard snow products. The average snow covered area of the HKH region based on satellite data from 2000 to 2010 is 0.76 million km2 which is 18.23% of5 the total geographical area of the region. The linear trend in annual snow cover from 2000 to 2010 is ???1.25??1.13%. This is in consistent with earlier reported decline of the decade from 1990 to 2001. A similar trend for western, central and eastern HKH region is 8.55??1.70%, +1.66%??2.26% and 0.82??2.50%, respectively. The snow covered area in spring for HKH region indicates a declining trend (???1.04??0.97%). The10 amount of annual snowfall is correlated with annual seasonal snow cover for the west- ern Himalaya, indicating that changes in snow cover are primarily due to interannual variations in circulation patterns. Snow cover trends over a decade were also found to vary across seasonally and the region. Snow cover trends for western HKH are pos- itive for all seasons. In central HKH the trend is positive (+15.53??5.69%) in autumn15 and negative (???03.68??3.01) in winter. In eastern HKH the trend is positive in summer (+3.35??1.62%) and autumn (+7.74??5.84%).

Changes in the spectrum and rates of extracellular enzyme activities in seawater following aggregate formation,"Abstract. Marine snow aggregates are heavily colonized by heterotrophic microorganisms that express high levels of hydrolytic activities, making aggregates hotspots for carbon remineralization in the ocean. To assess how aggregate for- mation influences the ability of seawater microbial commu- nities to access organic carbon, we compared hydrolysis rates of six polysaccharides in coastal seawater after aggregates had been formed (via incubation on a roller table) with hy- drolysis rates in seawater from the same site that had not in- cubated on a roller table (referred to as whole seawater). Hy- drolysis rates in the aggregates themselves were up to three orders of magnitude higher on a volume basis than in whole seawater. The enhancement of enzyme activity in aggregates relative to whole seawater differed by substrate, suggesting that the enhancement was under cellular control, rather than due to factors such as lysis or grazing. A comparison of hydrolysis rates in whole seawater with those in aggregate- free seawater, i.e. the fraction of water from the roller bottles that did not contain aggregates, demonstrated a nuanced mi- crobial response to aggregate formation. Activities of lam- inarinase and xylanase enzymes in aggregate-free seawater were higher than in whole seawater, while activities of chon- droitin, fucoidan, and arabinogalactan hydrolyzing enzymes were lower than in whole seawater. These data suggest that aggregate formation enhanced production of laminarinase and xylanase enzymes, and the enhancement also affected the surrounding seawater. Decreased activities of chon- droitin, fucoidan, and arabinoglactan-hydrolyzing enzymes in aggregate-free seawaters relative to whole seawater are likely due to shifts in enzyme production by the aggregate-","Marine snow aggregates constitute densely colonized micro- bial microenvironments that play an important role in organic matter remineralization in marine environments. Our results show that aggregate formation shapes the nature of microbial enzymatic response to organic matter, changing the spectrum of enzymes produced and affecting the rate and nature of enzymes active in the surrounding water column. Enzyme activities concentrated in the aggregates result in enhanced aggregate-associated hydrolytic activities that affect carbon remineralization on relatively small spatial scales compared to the surrounding water column. In the case of sinking ag- gregates, aggregate-associated activity can result in the en- hanced production of specific cell-free extracellular enzymes that escape from the aggregates, extending hydrolytic activ- ity beyond the spatial ?€?reach?€? of the aggregate. These cell- free enzymes that are released from aggregates into the sur- rounding seawater have the potential to retain activity over timescales sufficiently long to affect carbon remineralization in areas away from their site of production. Aggregate forma- tion can thus lead to spatial as well as temporal decoupling of enzyme activity from microorganisms associated with ma- rine snow. The presence and/or absence of aggregates might therefore in part explain spatial variations in enzyme activ- ities in pelagic ecosystems (Arnosti et al., 2005), and dis- connects between enzyme activities and other measures of microbial community activity (Chappell and Goulder, 1995; Murrell and Hollibaugh, 2000).",[]

Characterization of the organic composition of aerosols from Rond??nia Brazil during the LBASMOCC 2002 experiment and its representation through model ,"Abstract. The chemical composition of carbonaceous aerosols collected during the LBA-SMOCC field experiment, conducted in Rondo??nia, Brazil, in 2002 during the transition from the dry to the wet season, was investigated by a suite of state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The period of most intense biomass burning was characterized by high concen- trations of submicron particles rich in carbonaceous material and water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC). At the on- set of the rainy period, submicron total carbon (TC) concen- trations decreased by about 20 times. In contrast, the con- centration of supermicron TC was fairly constant through- out the experiment, pointing to a constant emission of coarse particles from the natural background. About 6?€?8% of TC (9?€?11% of WSOC) was speciated at the molecular level by GC-MS and liquid chromatography. Polyhydroxylated com- pounds, aliphatic and aromatic acids were the main classes of compounds accounted for by individual compound analysis. Functional group analysis by proton NMR and chromato- graphic separation on ion-exchange columns allowed char- acterization of ca. 50?€?90% of WSOC into broad chemical classes (neutral species/light acids/humic-like substances). In spite of the significant change in the chemical composi- tion of tracer compounds from the dry to the wet period, the functional groups and the general chemical classes of WSOC changed only to a small extent. Model compounds representing size-resolved WSOC chemical composition for","During the LBA-SMOCC field campaign, biomass burning emissions frequently caused episodes of very high concen- trations of submicron carbonaceous aerosol (submicron TC concentrations >50 ??gC m???3) in the period 9 September?€? 8 October 2002, while at the beginning of November, after the end of the intense burning period, the measured submi- cron TC concentrations were 20 times lower. At the same time, biogenic sources produced a constant background of aerosol throughout the campaign, which was found predom- inantly in the coarse mass fraction. Fine and coarse aerosol TC differ also with respect to their water-soluble fraction, which is 64% on average in the first case and only 34% in the latter. The EC accounted for 12% on average of TC in the fine fraction of the aerosol. A unique combination of analytical techniques for individual compound analysis was employed to speciate the aerosol organic compounds, resulting in the apportionment of up to 8% of the submicron TC (ca. 11% of WSOC). Carboxylic acids and polyhydrox- ylated compounds, comprising both pyrogenic and biogenic species, were the main classes of compounds speciated. Py- rogenic compounds include anhydrosugars, aromatic acids and aldehydes, while biogenic species include sugars, sugar- alcohols, 2-methyltetrols and malic acid. The ratio between total identified pyrogenic and biogenic compounds changed from 10:1 in the dry period to 1:3 in the wet period, showing that biomass burning was still active at the end of the field campaign.",['Rond??nia Brazil']

Charred forests accelerate snow albedo decay parameterizing the postfire radiative forcing on snow for three years following fire,"As large, high-severity forest fires increase and snowpacks become more vulnerable to climate change across the western USA, it is important to understand post-fire disturbance impacts on snow hydrology. Here, we examine, quantify, parameterize, model, and assess the post-fire radiative forcing effects on snow to improve hydrologic modelling of snow-dominated watersheds having experienced severe forest fires. Following a 2011 high-severity forest fire in the Oregon Cascades, we measured snow albedo, monitored snow, and micrometeorological conditions, sampled snow surface debris, and modelled snowpack energy and mass balance in adjacent burned forest (BF) and unburned forest sites. For three winters following the fire, charred debris in the BF reduced snow albedo, accelerated snow albedo decay, and increased snowmelt rates thereby advancing the date of snow disappearance compared with the unburned forest. We demonstrate a new parameterization of post-fire snow albedo as a function of days-since-snowfall and net snowpack energy balance using an empirically based exponential decay function. Incorporating our new post-fire snow albedo decay parameterization in a spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model, we show significantly improved predictions of snow cover duration and spatial variability of snow water equivalent across the BF, particularly during the late snowmelt period. Field measurements, snow model results, and remote sensing data demonstrate that charred forests increase the radiative forcing to snow and advance the timing of snow disappearance for several years following fire.

Chemical and morphological characterization of soot and soot precursors generated in an inverse diffusion flame with aromatic and aliphatic fuels,,"Tests of solubility in chloroform indicate that the percentage of extractable soot in an ethylene IDF flame diminishes from 94% in the sample taken near the burner face to 51% in the exhaust sam- ple; whereas, the percentage of extractable soot in the benzene IDF flame was smaller and below 50% for all heights sampled. These re- sults suggest that the degree of aromaticity of the condensed mate- rial in soot samples depends on the initial fuel (aliphatic or aromatic). This observation is also reflected in the average molec- ular weight, since the soot precursor material obtained at 6 mm in the ethylene flame showed the highest molecular weight (817 Dal- tons) among all the samples. However, as height above the burner increases, the molecular weight decreases and reaches a constant value around 370 Daltons.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of all samples show a high degree of similarity, with major contributions from carbohydrates, bound acetate, and lipids. Molecular level analyses of neutral sugars show seven monosaccharides, rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose, and galactose, to be abundant, and to occur in comparable relative amounts in each sample. Previous studies have emphasized the distinctive composition of dissolved humic substances in fresh and marine waters, and have attributed these differences to sources and transformations of organic matter unique to each environment. In contrast we find a large fraction of freshwater high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM; ??? 1kD) to be indistinguishable from marine HMWDOM in bulk and molecular-level chemical properties. Aquatic HMWDOM is similar in chemical composition to biologically derived acylated hetero- polysaccharides isolated from marine algal cultures, suggesting a biological source for some fraction of persistent HMWDOM. High molecular weight DOC contributes 51 ??? 26% of the total DOC, and monosac- charides 18 ??? 8% of the total HMWDOC in our freshwater samples. These contributions are on average higher and more variable, but not significantly different than for surface seawater (30% and 16% respectively). Biogeochemical processes that produce, accumulate, and recycle DOM may therefore share important similarities and be broadly comparable across a range of environmental settings.

Climate sensitivity and climate state,"Abstract The effective climate feedback/sensitivity, including its components, is a robust first order feature of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled global climate model (GCM) and presumably of the climate system. Feed- back/sensitivity characterizes the surface air temperature response to changes in radiative forcing and is constant, to first order, independent of the nature, history, and magnitude of the forcing and of the changing climate state. This ?€??€?constancy?€??€? can only be approximate, how- ever, and modest second order changes of 10?€?20% are found in stabilization simulations in which the forcing, based on the IS92a scenario, is fixed (stabilized) at year 2050 and 2100 values and the system is integrated for an additional 1000 years toward a new equilibrium. Both positive and negative feedback mechanisms tend to strengthen, with the balance tilted toward stronger negative feedback and hence weaker climate sensitivity, as the system evolves and warms. Some feedback mechanisms weaken locally, however, and an example of such is the ice/snow albedo feedback which is less effective in areas of the Northern Hemisphere where ice/ snow has retreated. Changes in the geographical distri- bution of the feedbacks are modest and weakening feedback in one region is often counteracted by strengthening feedback in other regions so that global and zonal values do not reflect the dominance of a particular mechanism or region but rather the residual of changes in different components and regions. The overall 10?€?20% strengthening of the negative feedback (decrease in climate sensitivity) in the CCCma model contrasts with a weakening of negative feedback (in- crease in climate sensitivity) of over 20% in the Hadley Centre model under similar conditions.

Column aerosol optical properties and aerosol radiative forcing during a serious hazefog month over North China Plain in 2013 based on groundbased ,"Abstract. In January 2013, North China Plain experienced several serious haze events. Cimel sunphotometer measure- ments at seven sites over rural, suburban and urban regions of North China Plain from 1 to 30 January 2013 were used to further our understanding of spatial-temporal variation of aerosol optical parameters and aerosol radiative forcing (ARF). It was found that Aerosol Optical Depth at 500 nm (AOD500nm) during non-pollution periods at all stations was lower than 0.30 and increased significantly to greater than 1.00 as pollution events developed. The Angstrom exponent (Alpha) was larger than 0.80 for all stations most of the time. AOD500nm averages increased from north to south during both polluted and non-polluted periods on the three urban sites in Beijing. The fine mode AOD during pollution peri- ods is about a factor of 2.5 times larger than that during the non-pollution period at urban sites but a factor of 5.0 at sub- urban and rural sites. The fine mode fraction of AOD675nm was higher than 80% for all sites during January 2013. The",,"['North China', 'North China Plain', 'China Plain']"
Combined impacts of current and future dust deposition and regional warming on Colorado River Basin snow dynamics and hydrology,"Abstract. The Colorado River provides water to 40 mil- lion people in seven western states and two countries and to 5.5 million irrigated acres. The river has long been over- allocated. Climate models project runoff losses of 5?€?20 % from the basin by mid-21st century due to human-induced climate change. Recent work has shown that decreased snow albedo from anthropogenic dust loading to the CO moun- tains shortens the duration of snow cover by several weeks relative to conditions prior to western expansion of the US in the mid-1800s, and advances peak runoff at Lees Ferry, Arizona, by an average of 3 weeks. Increases in evapotran- spiration from earlier exposure of soils and germination of plants have been estimated to decrease annual runoff by more than 1.0 billion cubic meters, or ??? 5% of the annual aver- age. This prior work was based on observed dust loadings during 2005?€?2008; however, 2009 and 2010 saw unprece- dented levels of dust loading on snowpacks in the Upper Col- orado River Basin (UCRB), being on the order of 5 times the 2005?€?2008 loading. Building on our prior work, we devel- oped a new snow albedo decay parameterization based on observations in 2009/10 to mimic the radiative forcing of ex- treme dust deposition. We convolve low, moderate, and ex- treme dust/snow albedos with both historic climate forcing and two future climate scenarios via a delta method pertur- bation of historic records. Compared to moderate dust, ex- treme dust absorbs 2?? to 4?? the solar radiation, and shifts","Our recent work has shown that decreased snow albedo from dust loading to the mountains of Colorado of the magni- tude observed in 2005?€?2008 shortens snow cover duration by several weeks relative to conditions prior to westward ex- pansion of the United States in the mid-1800s, and causes peak runoff from the UCRB to occur an average of 3 weeks earlier. Increased evapotranspiration losses due to the longer snow-free season were estimated to decrease annual runoff by about 5 % of the annual average flow. We developed a new snow albedo decay parameterization based on observations of the much higher dust loading observed in 2009/10, and examine the low, moderate, and extreme dust/snow albedos in combination with both historic climate forcing and two future climate scenarios. Extreme dust shifts peak snowmelt an additional 3 weeks earlier to a total of 6 weeks earlier than pre-disturbance, and reduces annual flow volume an ad- ditional 1 % (6 % compared to pre-disturbance). Sensitivity of flow timing to dust radiative forcing is maintained under future climate scenarios, but the sensitivity of flow volume appears to decrease with increased climate forcing. These re- sults have implications for water management and suggest that dust abatement efforts could be an important component of any climate adaptation strategies in the UCRB.","['Colorado', 'Colorado River', 'River Basin', 'United States', 'Colorado River Basin', 'US']"

Comparing simulated and measured sensible and latent heat fluxes over snow under a pine canopy to improve an energy balance snowmelt model,,"At the LSOS site, EC-measured and SNOBAL- simulated turbulent fluxes agree during periods of vi- able concurrent data within the 86-day analysis period when appropriate snow cover exchange layers were in- cluded in the model parameter set. Although the mea- sured and simulated fluxes show small differences dur- ing the analysis period, the largest discrepancies oc- curred at night. During night, conditions are stable with very cold near-surface temperatures and the dominance of longwave radiation exchange at the snow surface.

Comparison of pelagic and nepheloid layer marine snow implications for carbon cycling,"Marine snow from upper and mid-water (i.e., pelagic) depths on the California margin is texturally and compositionally different from that traveling in the nepheloid layer. Transmission electron microscopy shows that pelagic marine snow consists primarily of bioclasts (e.g., diatom frustules, foram tests), organic matter, and microbes. These components are entrained as discrete particles or small aggregates .??? 10 ??m in diameter) in a loose network of exocellular, muco-polysaccharide material. Clays are infrequent but, when present, are constituents of comparatively compact organic-rich microaggregates. Microbes are abundant and appear to decrease in number with increasing water depth. In contrast, marine snow aggregates collected from just above the sea floor in the nepheloid layer are assemblages of clay particles, clay flocs, and relatively dense clay?€?organic-rich microaggregates in an exocellular organic matrix. Bioclasts and microorganisms occur only rarely. The prevalence of clay?€?organic-rich aggregates in the nepheloid layer suggests that, prior to final deposition and burial, marine snow from the pelagic zone is subject to disaggregation and recombination with terrigenous detrital material near or at the sea floor. Results have significant implications for the accumulation and burial rates of organic carbon on continental margins and the aging and bioavailability of sedimentary organic matter.

Controls on annual nitrogen cycling in the understory of a subarctic birch forest,"Abstract. Characterization of the controls on annual nitrogen (N) cycling is critical to understanding the functioning of high-latitude ecosystems and to predicting their responses to perturbations. Here, we describe an experimental evaluation of the effects of season and vegetation on annual N cycling in the understory heath vegetation of a subarctic birch forest. Our approach was to follow the partitioning of an isotopically enriched 15NH4Cl addition between microbes, plants, and the soil solution at intervals through winter, and in the following summer. To investigate the direct influence of vegetation on ecosystem N cycling, the isotope was added to control plots and to plots from which plants had been removed early in the previous growing season.",,[]

Deformation of electrodeposited nanocrystalline nickel,"The mechanisms of deformation and damage evolution in electrodeposited, fully dense, nanocrystalline Ni with an average grain size of ~30 nm and a narrow grain size distribution were investigated by recourse to (i) tensile tests performed in situ in the transmission electron microscope and (ii) microscopic observations made at high resolution following ex situ deformation induced by compression, rolling and nanoindentation. Particular attention was also devoted to the characterization of the structure in grain interiors and in the vicinity of grain boundaries at Angstrom- level resolution in the as-deposited material and following compression, and to the real-time video-imaging of the evolution of dislocation activity and damage during deformation; these images are presented in this paper and in the web sites provided as supplementary material to this paper. These observations clearly reveal that dislocation-mediated plasticity plays a dominant role in the deformation of nanocrystalline Ni examined in this study. Fracture surface examination confirms dimpled rupture with the scale of the dimples being several times larger than the grain size. Dislocation emission at grain boundaries together with intragranular slip and unaccommodated grain boundary sliding facilitate the nucleation of voids at boundaries and triple junctions. Individual monocrystal ligaments, formed by the growth/linking of these voids, undergo extensive local plasticity to the extent that many of them neck down to a chisel point. These voids as well as those that may have existed prior to deformation can act as nucleation sites for dimples leading to fracture that does not occur preferentially along grain boundaries. The transmission electron microscopy observations of in situ and ex situ deformed specimens are synthesized to formulate a mechanistic framework that provides new insights into the mechanisms of flow and fracture in nanostructured metals. ??? 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

Deglacial changes in dust flux in the eastern equatorial Pacific,"Atmospheric dust levels may play important roles in feedbacks linking continental source areas, tropical convection, marine productivity, and global climate. These feedbacks appear to be particularly significant in the tropical Pacific, where variations in local convection and productivity have been demonstrated to have impacts on climate at higher latitudes. Modeling of past dust levels and related feedbacks has been limited, however, by a paucity of observational data. In this study we present a temporal and spatial survey of dust fluxes to the eastern equatorial Pacific over the past 30 kyr. Glacial and Holocene fluxes of 232Th, a proxy for continental material, were calculated by normalization to 230Th from a north?€?south transect of cores along 110??W between 3??S and 7??N (ODP sites 848?€?853). Fluxes were 30?€?100% higher during the last glacial, suggesting increased dustiness in both hemispheres during the glacial period. In both time periods, dust fluxes decrease towards the south, reflecting scavenging of Northern Hemisphere dust by precipitation at the ITCZ. The Holocene meridional dust flux gradient between 7??N and 3??S is characterized by a steep drop in dust levels at the southern edge of the modern range of the ITCZ, while the gradient is shallower and more nearly linear during the last glacial. This change may indicate that the glacial ITCZ in this region was a less effective barrier to inter- hemispheric dust transport, most likely due to a decrease in convective intensity and precipitation during the last glacial; alternatively, the change in gradient may be explained by increased variability in the location of the glacial ITCZ. Our data do not appear to require a mean southerly displacement of the glacial ITCZ, as suggested by the results of other studies. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Desert dust deposition on Mt Elbrus Caucasus Mountains Russia in 20092012 as recorded in snow and shallow ice core highresolution provenancing transport ,"A record of dust deposition events between 2009 and 2012 on Mt. Elbrus, Cauca- sus Mountains derived from a snow pit and a shallow ice core is presented for the first time for this region. A combination of isotopic analysis, SEVIRI red-green-blue composite imagery, MODIS atmospheric optical depth fields derived using the Deep5 Blue algorithm, air mass trajectories derived using the HYSPLIT model and analysis of meteorological data enabled identification of dust source regions with high temporal (hours) and spatial (cf. 20?€?100 km) resolution. Seventeen dust deposition events were detected; fourteen occurred in March?€?June, one in February and two in October. Four events originated in the Sahara, predominantly in north-eastern Libya and eastern Al-10 geria. Thirteen events originated in the Middle East, in the Syrian Desert and northern Mesopotamia, from a mixture of natural and anthropogenic sources. Dust transporta- tion from Sahara was associated with vigorous Saharan depressions, strong surface winds in the source region and mid-tropospheric south-westerly flow with daily winds speeds of 20?€?30 m s???1 at 700 hPa level and, although these events were less frequent,15 they resulted in higher dust concentrations in snow. Dust transportation from the Mid- dle East was associated with weaker depressions forming over the source region, high pressure centered over or extending towards the Caspian Sea and a weaker southerly or south-easterly flow towards the Caucasus Mountains with daily wind speeds of 12?€? 18 m s???1 at 700 hPa level. Higher concentrations of nitrates and ammonium charac-20 terise dust from the Middle East deposited on Mt. Elbrus in 2009 indicating contribu- tion of anthropogenic sources. The modal values of particle size distributions ranged between 1.98 ??m and 4.16 ??m. Most samples were characterised by modal values of 2.0?€?2.8 ??m with an average of 2.6 ??m and there was no significant difference between dust from the Sahara and the Middle East.25","A four-year record of desert dust deposition events, derived from a snow pit and a shal- low ice core, encompassing the 2009?€?2012 period was for the first time presented for the Caucasus Mountains, Russia. The elevation and climatic characteristics of Mt. El-15 brus made it ideal for trapping and preserving dust in snow and glacier ice.

The main source regions20 of dust were the northern Sahara (especially north-eastern Libya and Algeria), the Syrian Desert and northern Mesopotamia.

Determining generative models of objects under varying illumination Shape and albedo from multiple images using SVD and integrability,"We describe a method of learning generative models of objects from a set of images of the object under different, and unknown, illumination. Such a model allows us to approximate the objects?€? appearance under a range of lighting conditions. This work is closely related to photometric stereo with unknown light sources and, in particular, to the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to estimate shape and albedo from multiple images up to a linear transformation [15]. Firstly we analyze and extend the SVD approach to this problem. We demonstrate that it applies to objects for which the dominant imaging effects are Lambertian reflectance with a distant light source and a background ambient term. To determine that this is a reasonable approximation we calculate the eigenvectors of the SVD on a set of real objects, under varying lighting conditions, and demonstrate that the first few eigenvectors account for most of the data in agreement with our predictions. We then analyze the linear ambiguities in the SVD approach and demonstrate that previous methods proposed to resolve them [15] are only valid under certain conditions. We discuss alternative possibilities and, in particular, demonstrate that knowledge of the object class is sufficient to resolve this problem. Secondly, we describe the use of surface consistency for putting constraints on the possible solutions. We prove that this constraint reduces the ambiguities to a subspace called the generalized bas relief ambiguity (GBR) which is inherent in the Lambertian reflectance function (and which can be shown to exist even if attached and cast shadows are present [3]). We demonstrate the use of surface consistency to solve for the shape and albedo up to a GBR and describe, and implement, a variety of additional assumptions to resolve the GBR. Thirdly, we demonstrate an iterative algorithm that can detect and remove some attached shadows from the objects thereby increasing the accuracy of the reconstructed shape and albedo.","In this paper we have argued for generative models of object appearance and have stressed the necessity of modeling each factor ?€? shape, albedo, illumination ?€? independently. In particular, we have considered the special case of determining generative models when the input consists of multiple views of the same object, at similar poses, under different illumination conditions.",[]
Determining snow specific surface area from nearinfrared reflectance measurements Numerical study of the influence of grain shape,,"We compute snow albedo-SSA relationships for various grain shapes using ray tracing simulations and conclude that for a given albedo, SSA can vary in a range of ??20% depending solely on the grain shape. In the context of estimating SSA from albedo measurements, this translates into ??20% error on SSA when the grain shape is unknown. One may argue that this error is pessimistic because all the grains have the same size and shape in a given simulation and the shapes are geometrically perfect (spheres, cubes, cubic depth-hoar, cylinders, hyperboloids, irregular cubes and tetrahedral fractal grains). We tested both size distribution and less regular shapes (cubes whose faces were tilted randomly) and found minor differences with respect to single size distribution or perfect shapes. However, natural metamorphosed snow is always composed of a mixture of shapes. Facets and sharp angles appear in dry snow subjected to high",[]
Developing a cloudreduced MODIS surface reflectance product for snow cover mapping in mountainous regions,"Abstract: Cloud obscuration is a major problem for using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images in different applications. This issue poses serious difficulties in monitoring the snow cover in mountainous regions due to high cloudiness in such areas. To overcome this, different cloud removal methods have been developed in the past where most of them use MODIS snow cover products and spatiotemporal dependencies of snow to estimate the undercloud coverage. In this study, a new approach is adopted that uses surface reflectance data in the cloud-free pixels and estimates the surface reflectance of a cloudy pixel as if there were no cloud. This estimation is obtained by subsequently applying the k-nearest neighbor and dynamic time compositing methods. The modified surface reflectance data are then utilized as inputs of a Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)-based algorithm to map snow cover in the study area. The results indicate that the suggested approach is able to appropriately estimate undercloud surface reflectance in bands 2, 4 and 6, and can map the snow cover with 97% accuracy, which is a substantial improvement over the conventional method with an accuracy of 86%. Finally, although a clear underestimation of snow cover (about 15%) is observed by applying the proposed approach, still, it is much better than the 30% underestimation obtained by the conventional method.", Cloud obscuration is a major challenge in using MODIS images for snow cover mapping.

Development of an approach for generation of temporally complete daily nadir MODIS reflectance time series,,"The availability of calibrated and systematically processed satellite data provided by the latest generation of moderate resolution remote sensing systems allows for major advances in terrestrial monitoring at regional to global scale (Justice et al., 2002). Many terrestrial monitoring applications ideally require consistent and temporally complete surface reflectance time series that are free of data gaps and corrected for remote sensing induced variations. This paper presents an approach for generation of temporally complete daily nadir BRDF- adjusted surface reflectance (NBAR) time series from MODIS observations. The innovations of the approach are: 1) a semi-physical outlier detection algorithm to remove residual anomalous MODIS observations undetected in the upstream processing, 2) generation of NBAR time series by full BRDF model inversion on a daily basis when",[]

Different characteristics of char and soot in the atmosphere and their ratio as an indicator for source identification in Xian China,"Abstract. Numerous definitions and analytical techniques for elemental (or black) carbon (EC) have been published in the scientific literature, but still no generally accepted inter- disciplinary definition exists. EC is not a single chemical compound, but is mainly composed of two parts of carbon contents: combustion residues from pyrolysis and combus- tion emissions formed via gas-to-particle conversion. Ac- cordingly EC is subdivided into two classes: char and soot. Char is defined as carbonaceous materials obtained by heat- ing organic substances and formed directly from pyroly- sis, or as an impure form of graphitic carbon obtained as a residue when carbonaceous material is partially burned or heated with limited access of air. Soot is defined as only those carbon particles that form at high temperature via gas- phase processes. Since the different classes of EC have dif- ferent chemical and physical properties, their optical light- absorbing properties differ, so that it is essential to differ- entiate them in the environment. The thermal optical re- flectance (TOR) method was used to differentiate between char-EC and soot-EC according to its stepwise thermal evo- lutional oxidation of different carbon fractions under differ- ent temperatures and atmosphere. Char-EC and soot-EC are operationally defined as EC1-OP and EC2+EC3 (EC1, EC2 and EC3 corresponding to carbon fractions evolved at 550, 700 and 800 ???C in a 98% He/2% O2 atmosphere, respec- tively), respectively. One year of observations of the daily and seasonal variations of carbonaceous particles were con- ducted in Xi?€?an, China in 2004 to demonstrate the different characteristics of char and soot in the atmosphere. Total car- bon (TC), organic carbon (OC), EC and char-EC showed","This study demonstrates that char and soot have different dis- tribution characteristics in the atmosphere. Similar to previ- ous reported TC, OC and total EC, char-EC showed high sea- sonal variations, with the maximum concentrations in win- ter (10.49??5.95 ??g m???3) being ???4 times of that in summer (2.57??1.82 ??g m???3). This is associated with Xi?€?an winter heating. However, soot-EC revealed only small variations in different seasons, and this variation is probably in part due to the wet scavenging. Strong correlations between EC and char-EC suggest that char-EC concentrations can be calcu- lated from previously reported EC concentrations. However, previously reported total EC in the literature reflected the dis- tribution characteristics of char only, while soot?€?s distribution characteristics may be overlooked. Soot-EC can be seen as a background fraction, contributing to 18.4% of Xi?€?an total EC on average, and had a background value of ???1.15 ??g m???3","['China', 'Xian China']"

Diffusion of chromium in nanocrystalline iron produced by means of surface mechanical attrition treatment,"By means of surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) to a pure iron plate, a nanometer-grained surface layer without porosity and contamination was fabricated. The average grain size in the top surface layer (of 5 ??m thick) is about 10?€?25 nm, and the grain size stability can be maintained up to 653 K. Cr diffusion kinetics in the nanocrystalline Fe phase was measured by using second ion mass spectrometry within a temperature range of 573?€?653 K. Experimental results showed that diffusivity of Cr in the nanocrystalline Fe is 7?€?9 orders of magnitude higher than that in Fe lattice and 4?€?5 orders of magnitude higher than that in the grain boundaries (GBs) of ??-Fe. The activation energy for Cr diffusion in the Fe nanophase is comparable to that of the GB diffusion, but the pre-exponential factor is much higher. The enhanced diffusivity of Cr may originate from a large volume fraction of non-equilibrium GBs and a considerable amount of triple junctions in the present nanocrystalline Fe sample processed by means of the SMAT technique. ??? 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

Direct and semidirect radiative forcing of smoke aerosols over clouds,"Abstract. Observations from Earth observing satellites in- dicate that dark carbonaceous aerosols that absorb solar ra- diation are widespread in the tropics and subtropics. When these aerosols mix with clouds, there is generally a reduc- tion of cloudiness owing to absorption of solar energy in the aerosol layer. Over the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean, where smoke from savannah burning in southern Africa re- sides above a persistent deck of marine stratocumulus clouds, radiative heating of the smoke layer leads to a thicken- ing of the cloud layer. Here, satellite observations of the albedo of overcast scenes of 25 km2 size or larger are com- bined with additional satellite observations of clouds and aerosols to estimate the top-of-atmosphere direct radiative forcing attributable to presence of dark aerosol above bright cloud, and the negative semi-direct forcing attributable to the thickening of the cloud layer. The average positive di- rect radiative forcing by smoke over an overcast scene is 9.2??6.6 W m???2 for cases with an unambiguous signal of ab- sorbing aerosol over cloud in passive ultraviolet remote sens- ing observations. However, cloud liquid water path is en- hanced by 16.3??7.7 g m???2 across the range of values for sea surface temperature for cases of smoke over cloud. The neg- ative radiative forcing associated with this semi-direct effect of smoke over clouds is estimated to be ???5.9??3.5 W m???2. Therefore, the cooling associated with the semi-direct cloud thickening effect compensates for greater than 60 % of the direct radiative effect. Accounting for the frequency of occurrence of significant absorbing aerosol above overcast scenes leads to an estimate of the average direct forcing of 1.0??0.7 W m???2 contributed by these scenes averaged over the subtropical southeast Atlantic Ocean during austral win- ter. The regional average of the negative semi-direct forcing is ???0.7??0.4 W m???2.

Dynamic discontinuous stream networks hydrologically driven variations in active drainage density flowing channels and stream order,"Despite decades of research on the ecological consequences of stream network expansion, contraction and fragmentation, surprisingly little is known about the hydrological mechanisms that shape these processes. Here, we present field surveys of the active drainage networks of four California headwater streams (4?€?27 km2) spanning diverse topographic, geologic and climatic settings. We show that these stream networks dynamically expand, contract, disconnect and reconnect across all the sites we studied. Stream networks at all four sites contract and disconnect during seasonal flow recessions, with their total active network length, and thus their active drainage densities, decreasing by factors of two to three across the range of flows captured in our field surveys. The total flowing lengths of the active stream networks are approximate power-law functions of unit discharge, with scaling exponents averaging 0.27 ?? 0.04 (range: 0.18?€?0.40). The number of points where surface flow originates obey similar power-law relationships, as do the lengths and origination points of flowing networks that are continuously connected to the outlet, with scaling exponents averaging 0.36?€?0.48. Even stream order shifts seasonally by up to two Strahler orders in our study catchments. Broadly, similar stream length scaling has been observed in catchments spanning widely varying geologic, topographic and climatic settings and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in size, suggesting that network extension/contraction is a general phenomenon that may have a general explanation. Points of emergence or disappearance of surface flow represent the balance between subsurface transmissivity in the hyporheic zone and the delivery of water from upstream. Thus the dynamics of stream network expansion and contraction, and connection and disconnection, may offer important clues to the spatial structure of the hyporheic zone, and to patterns and processes of runoff generation.

Ecosystem engineering by annual intertidal seagrass beds sediment accretion and modification,"Seagrasses are generally known as ecosystem engineers, as they reduce flow velocities in their canopies. In perennial subtidal meadows, this usually leads to increased net sedimentation rates and reduction of the grain size. The present study aims to describe the contribution of annual seagrass populations to these processes and elucidate the temporal dynamics. Sediment accretion and grain size modification were experimen- tally tested by transplanting seedlings of an annual intertidal eelgrass population to an unvegetated tidal flat. Within the planting units (79 shoots m???2) 4.7 mm of sediment accreted, whereas in the most dense parts of these units (199 shoots m???2) accretion amounted to 7.1 mm. The silt fraction (<63 mm) increased and the sand fraction (63e500 mm) decreased in the eelgrass beds, which provides evidence that higher silt content in seagrass beds is the result and not the cause of seagrass presence. Annual intertidal eelgrass beds significantly con- tribute to the immobilisation of sediment during the growing season with its magnitude depending on canopy density. During winter, the accu- mulated sediments were released again and could even induce additional erosion. Possible consequences of these sediment dynamics for the larger scale functioning of estuarine ecosystems are discussed. ??? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of covariance between ablation and snow water equivalent on depletion of snowcovered area in a forest,"Abstract: The in??uence of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent and covariance between spatial distributions of ablation and snow water equivalent on depletion of snowcover was investigated in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, Canada. Changes in the spatial distributions of snow water equivalent were measured before and during melt in ??ve stands, ranked by canopy density as: black spruce, jack pine, mixed wood, burned and recent clear-cut. The pre-melt frequency distribution of snow water equivalent within forest stands was found to ??t a log- normal distribution. Higher variability in snow water equivalent resulted in earlier exposure of ground under spatially uniform melt simulations, con??rming the previous ??ndings of others for open environments. The spatial distribution of daily ablation within stands was found, however, to be correlated inversely to the distribution of snow water equivalent. This negative covariance between snow water equivalent and ablation further accelerated snow cover depletion. The combined acceleration as a result of variance of snow water equivalent and covariance with ablation was greatest in mixed-wood stands and smallest in burned and spruce stands. Simulations that included the within-stand covariance of ablation and snow water equivalent showed improved ??t with measured data over those that only considered the e???ect of the distribution of snow water equivalent on snow-cover depletion.

Effect of land albedo CO2 orography and oceanic heat transport on extreme  climates,"Abstract. Using an atmospheric general circulation model of intermediate complexity coupled to a sea ice ?€? slab ocean model, we perform a number of sensitivity experiments un- der present-day orbital conditions and geographical distribu- tion to assess the possibility that land albedo, atmospheric CO2, orography and oceanic heat transport may cause an ice- covered Earth. Changing only one boundary or initial con- dition, the model produces solutions with at least some ice- free oceans in the low latitudes. Using some combination of these forcing parameters, a full Earth?€?s glaciation is ob- tained. We find that the most significant factor leading to an ice-covered Earth is the high land albedo in combination with initial temperatures set equal to the freezing point. Oceanic heat transport and orography play only a minor role for the climate state. Extremely low concentrations of CO2 also ap- pear to be insufficient to provoke a runaway ice-albedo feed- back, but the strong deviations in surface air temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere point to the existence of a strong nonlinearity in the system. Finally, we argue that the ini- tial condition determines whether the system can go into a completely ice covered state, indicating multiple equilibria, a feature known from simple energy balance models.",,"['Earth', 'Northern Hemisphere']"

Effect of precipitation seasonality on climatic sensitivity of glacier mass balance,,"The climatic sensitivities of glacier mass balance were correlated onlywith annual precipitation in the previous studies by Oerlemans and Fortuin (1992) and Raper and Braithwaite (2006). Annual precipitation affects the temperature conditionon theELA (Ohmura et al.,1992; Fujita, 2008), and thuswarming prolongs themelt seasonmore effectively in a humid environment as shown in Fig. 4b (Oerlemans and Fortuin, 1992). Those authors validated their approaches by examining real glaciers worldwide in which both summer-type and winter-type glaciers might be included. However, their parameterization of the sensitivities with annual precipitation should neglect the effect of precipitation season- ality, whichwas involved in the observational data, because of the great number of examined glaciers sampled from the Euro-American climate. Fujita (2008) showed that the precipitation seasonality, more than the amount, significantly affected the climatic sensitivities of glacier mass balance using the same conceptual model. In addition to his study, we show that the concentration of seasonality more obviously alters the climatic sensitivity of glacier mass balance. The present study suggests that the parameterization of glacier mass balance with annual precipitation amount is insufficient to describe the response of glaciers to climate change. Distribution of precipitation seasonality (PSI) and its concentration (SCI) suggest that many parts of the world belong to the summer-precipitation climate but their seasonality concentration is not significant worldwide. On the other hand, the extensive region of Asia and a part of the Andes are located in the highly concentrated summer- precipitation climate. It suggests the high sensitivity of the glacier mass balance in these regions to climate change. The contribution of glacier shrinkage worldwide or climatic implication of glacier fluctuation has been examined by the numerical approach, in which mainly the effects of annual or seasonal changes in air temperature were discussed. The present study shows, however, that the changes in precipitation seasonality and seasonality concentration also alter the condition of glacier mass balance. Acknowledgements","['Andes', 'Asia']"

Effect of snow microstructure variability on Kuband radar snow water equivalent retrievals,"Abstract. Spatial variability in snowpack properties nega- tively impacts our capacity to make direct measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) using satellites. A comprehen- sive data set of snow microstructure (94 profiles at 36 sites) and snow layer thickness (9000 vertical profiles across nine trenches) collected over two winters at Trail Valley Creek, NWT, Canada, was applied in synthetic radiative transfer experiments. This allowed for robust assessment of the im- pact of estimation accuracy of unknown snow microstruc- tural characteristics on the viability of SWE retrievals. Depth hoar layer thickness varied over the shortest horizontal dis- tances, controlled by subnivean vegetation and topography, while variability in total snowpack thickness approximated that of wind slab layers. Mean horizontal correlation lengths of layer thickness were less than a metre for all layers. Depth hoar was consistently ??? 30 % of total depth, and with in- creasing total depth the proportion of wind slab increased at the expense of the decreasing surface snow layer. Distinct differences were evident between distributions of layer prop- erties; a single median value represented density and spe- cific surface area (SSA) of each layer well. Spatial variability in microstructure of depth hoar layers dominated SWE re- trieval errors. A depth hoar SSA estimate of around 7 % un- der the median value was needed to accurately retrieve SWE.

Effects of changing scale on landscape pattern analysis scaling relations,"Landscape pattern is spatially correlated and scale-dependent. Thus, understanding landscape structure and func- tioning requires multiscale information, and scaling functions are the most precise and concise way of quantify- ing multiscale characteristics explicitly. The major objective of this study was to explore if there are any scaling relations for landscape pattern when it is measured over a range of scales ???grain size and extent???. The results showed that the responses of landscape metrics to changing scale fell into two categories when computed at the class level ???i.e., for individual land cover types???: simple scaling functions and unpredictable behavior. Similarly, three categories were found at the landscape level, with the third being staircase pattern, in a previous study when all land cover types were combined together. In general, scaling relations were more variable at the class level than at the landscape level, and more consistent and predictable with changing grain size than with chang- ing extent at both levels. Considering that the landscapes under study were quite diverse in terms of both com- position and configuration, these results seem robust. This study highlights the need for multiscale analysis in order to adequately characterize and monitor landscape heterogeneity, and provides insights into the scaling of landscape patterns.","Landscape metrics have been widely used in ecologi- cal and geographical studies and provided valuable insight into the structural characteristics of complex landscapes. However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the scale sensitivity of these metrics seriously undermines their interpretation and useful- ness. This study has systematically investigated how landscape metrics respond to changing grain size and extent, allowing for exploration of general scaling re- lations and idiosyncratic behaviors.",[]

Effects of inert dust on olive Olea europaea L leaf physiological parameters,"Background. Cement factories are major pollutants for the surround- ing areas. Inert dust deposition has been found to affect photosyn- thesis, stomatal functioning and productivity. Very few studies have been conducted on the effects of cement kiln dust on the physiology of perennial fruit crops. Our goal was to study some cement dust effects on olive leaf physiology. Methods. Cement kiln dust has been applied periodically since April 2003 onto olive leaves. Cement dust accumulation and various leaf physiological parameters were evaluated early in July 2003. Mea- surements were also taken on olive trees close to the cement factory. Results. Leaf dry matter content and specific leaf weight increased with leaf age and dust content. Cement dust decreased leaf total chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio. As a re- sult, photosynthetic rate and quantum yield decreased. In addition, transpiration rate slightly decreased, stomatal conductance to H2O and CO2 movement decreased, internal CO2 concentration remained constant and leaf temperature increased. Discussion. The changes in chlorophyll are possibly due to shading and/or photosystem damage. The changes in stomatal functioning were possibly due to dust accumulation between the peltates or other effects on stomata. Conclusions. Dust (in this case from a cement kiln) seems to cause substantial changes to leaf physiology, possibly leading to reduced olive productivity. Recommendations. Avoidance of air contamination from cement factories by using available technology should be examined together with any possible methodologies to reduce plant tissue contamina- tion from cement dust. Perspectives. Longterm effects of dust (from cement kiln or other sources) on olive leaf, plant productivity and nutritional quality of edible parts could be studied for conclusive results on dust contami- nation effects to perennial crops.",,[]

Depending on ATD concentration, hetero- geneous ice nucleation occurred at temperatures as high as 256 K or down to the onset of homogeneous ice nucleation (237 K). For ATD-induced ice formation Classical Nucle- ation Theory (CNT) offers a suitable framework to param- eterize nucleation rates as a function of temperature, experi- mentally determined ATD size, and emulsion droplet volume distributions. The latter two quantities serve to estimate the total heterogeneous surface area present in a droplet, whereas the suitability of an individual heterogeneous site to trigger nucleation is described by the compatibility function (or con- tact angle) in CNT. The intensity ratio of homogeneous to heterogeneous freezing peaks is in good agreement with the assumption that the ATD particles are randomly distributed amongst the emulsion droplets. The observed dependence of the heterogeneous freezing temperatures on ATD concen- trations cannot be described by assuming a constant contact angle for all ATD particles, but requires the ice nucleation efficiency of ATD particles to be (log)normally distributed amongst the particles. Best quantitative agreement is reached when explicitly assuming that high-compatibility sites are rare and that therefore larger particles have on average more and better active sites than smaller ones. This analysis sug- gests that a particle has to have a diameter of at least 0.1 ??m to exhibit on average one active site.",DSC freezing experiments with emulsified aqueous suspen- sions of ATD showed that this mineral dust acts as immersion,['Arizona']

Elemental carbon in snow at Changbai Mountain northeastern China concentrations scavenging ratios and dry deposition velocities,"Abstract. Light-absorbing aerosol ?€? particularly elemental carbon (EC) ?€? while mixed with snow and ice is an impor- tant climate driver from the enhanced absorption of solar radiation. Currently, considerable efforts are being made to estimate its radiative forcing on a global scale, but several uncertainties remain, particularly those regarding its depo- sition processes. In this study, concurrent measurements of EC in air and snow are performed for three years (2009?€? 2012) at Changbai station, northeastern China. The scav- enging ratio and the wet- and dry-deposition fluxes of EC over the snow surface are estimated. The mean EC concen- tration in the surface snow is 1000 ?? 1500 ng g???1, ranging from 7 to 7640 ng g???1. The mean value of the scavenging ratio of EC by snow is 140 ?? 100, with a median value of 150, which is smaller than that reported in Arctic areas. A non-rimed snow process is a significant factor in inter- preting differences with Arctic areas. Wet-deposition fluxes of EC are estimated to be 0.47 ?? 0.37 ??g cm???2 month???1 on average over the three snow seasons studied. Dry depo- sition is more than five times higher, with an average of 2.65 ?? 1.93 ??g cm???2 month???1; however, only winter period estimation is possible (December?€?February). During win- ter in Changbai, 87 % of EC in snow is estimated to be due to dry deposition, with a mean dry deposition veloc- ity of 6.44 ?? 10???3 m s???1 and median of 8.14 ?? 10???3 m s???1. Finally, the calculation of the radiative effect shows that 500 ng g???1 of dry-deposited EC to a snow surface absorbs three times more incoming solar energy than the same mass mixed in the snow through wet deposition. Deposition pro-","Measurements of elemental carbon in the snow surface at the Changbai station, northeastern China, were performed over three snow seasons, and the values spanned from 7 to 7640 ng g???1 with a mean of 1000 ?? 1500 ng g???1. The scavenging ratio of EC was derived to be 140 on aver- age, which was in the range of the values reported in the rural area at the same latitude and similar to those re- ported for Arctic areas. Chemical analyses indicated that non-rimed processes tended to be the most common re- moval mechanisms of EC from the atmosphere when wet deposition was considered. The wet-deposition flux was esti- mated to be 0.47 ?? 0.37 ??g cm???2 month???1 in winter, which was three times lower than the dry flux, estimated to be 2.65 ?? 1.93 ??g cm???2 month???1. The mean dry-deposition ve- locity was estimated to be 6.44 ?? 10???3 m s???1, with a median of 8.14 ?? 10???3 m s???1. For the three years studied, 87 % of the EC in the surface snow was attributed to dry deposition. Finally, the radiative transfer calculations showed that dry- deposited BC, at the air?€?snow interface, strongly enhanced the amount of absorbing radiation as compared to the same mass of BC that was wet-deposited, leading to an increase in the melting rate of the snowpack.","['Changbai Mountain', 'Changbai', 'China']"
Elemental carbon in Svalbard snow from local sources and its impact on surface albedo,"Svalbard, a remote archipelago in the Arctic, is affected by both long-range and local pollution. In this thesis, the elemental carbon (EC) concentrations in the snow pack and its effect upon surface albedo have been investigated. The impact of local EC sources for the snow pack have for the first time been estimated. That was done by gathering snow samples from the snow pack along transects around Longyearbyen, Ny-??lesund, and Svea in 2008. Some of these samples were taken in pristine areas. These samples were melted and filtered at UNIS. The final EC analysis was done at ITM in Stockholm. Since this analysis is both expensive and time demanding, an alternative method was investigated. Simple snow stratigraphy investigations were done in every snow pit. This was compared to weather data in order to date the snow layers. Model runs from the Oslo CTM2 chemical transport model were compared with the EC measurements. The local EC emissions in Svalbard were estimated and compared to the long-range transported EC. Finally, a possible relation between EC concentration and the isotope parameter ??18O was investigated.",,"['Oslo', 'Svalbard']"

Enhanced algorithm for estimating snow depth from geostationary satellites,Received 2 August 2005; received in revised form 2 November 2006; accepted 4 November 2006 Abstract,"A new enhanced algorithm for estimating snow depth from satellite observations in the visible spectral band is presented. As compared with the earlier algorithm developed solely for prairie environments, the new technique extends snow depth retrievals to partially forested areas. Estimating snow depth is possible owing to the fact that changing snow depth affects the fraction of the land surface masked by snow and as a result, changes the visible reflectance of the land surface. The relationship between the snow depth and snow fraction is mostly due to low-level vegetation protruding through the snow pack. It is the strongest over plain non-forested areas and decreases in forests and areas with heterogeneous topography.",[]

Enhanced climatic warming in the Tibetan Plateau due to doubling CO2 a model study,"Abstract The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) regional climate model (RegCM2), together with initial conditions and time-dependent lat- eral boundary conditions provided by a 130-year tran- sient increasing CO2 simulation of the NCAR Climate System Model (CSM), has been used to investigate the mechanism of ground warming over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The model results show that when CO2 in the at- mosphere is doubled, a strong ground warming occurs in the TP. Two regions within it with the largest warming are in the eastern TP (region I) and along the south- western and western slopes (region II). Moreover, in region I the ground warming in the winter half year is stronger than that in the summer half year, but in region II the warming difference between the seasons becomes opposite to that in region I, i.e., the warming is strong in the summer half year and weak in the winter half year. There are indications that the summer monsoon en- hances but the winter monsoon weakens when CO2 is doubled. A strong elevation dependency of ground warming is found in region I for the winter half year, and in region II for both winter and summer half years at elevations below 5 km. The simulated characteristics of ground warming in the TP are consistent with the observations. In region I, when CO2 is doubled, the",In the next section the model used and experimental design will be outlined.

Enhanced coldseason warming in semiarid regions,"Abstract. This study examined surface air temperature trends over global land from 1901?€?2009. It is found that the warming trend was particularly enhanced, in the bo- real cold season (November to March) over semi-arid re- gions (with precipitation of 200?€?600 mm yr???1) showing a temperature increase of 1.53 ???C as compared to the global annual mean temperature increase of 1.13 ???C over land. In mid-latitude semi-arid areas of Europe, Asia, and North America, temperatures in the cold season increased by 1.41, 2.42, and 1.5 ???C, respectively. The semi-arid regions con- tribute 44.46 % to global annual-mean land-surface tempera- ture trend. The mid-latitude semi-arid regions in the Northern Hemisphere contribute by 27.0 % of the total, with the mid- latitude semi-arid areas in Europe, Asia, and North Amer- ica accounting for 6.29 %, 13.81 %, and 6.85 %, respectively. Such enhanced semi-arid warming (ESAW) imply drier and warmer trend of these regions.",,['Northern Hemisphere']
Enhanced solar energy absorption by internallymixed black carbon in snow grains,"Abstract. Here we explore light absorption by snowpack containing black carbon (BC) particles residing within ice grains. Basic considerations of particle volumes and BC/snow mass concentrations show that there are generally 0.05?€?109 BC particles for each ice grain. This suggests that internal BC is likely distributed as multiple inclusions within ice grains, and thus the dynamic effective medium approxi- mation (DEMA) (Chy??lek and Srivastava, 1983) is a more ap- propriate optical representation for BC/ice composites than coated-sphere or standard mixing approximations. DEMA calculations show that the 460 nm absorption cross-section of BC/ice composites, normalized to the mass of BC, is typ- ically enhanced by factors of 1.8?€?2.1 relative to interstitial BC. BC effective radius is the dominant cause of variation in this enhancement, compared with ice grain size and BC volume fraction. We apply two atmospheric aerosol models that simulate interstitial and within-hydrometeor BC lifecy- cles. Although only ???2 % of the atmospheric BC burden is cloud-borne, 71?€?83 % of the BC deposited to global snow and sea-ice surfaces occurs within hydrometeors. Key pro- cesses responsible for within-snow BC deposition are devel- opment of hydrophilic coatings on BC, activation of liquid droplets, and subsequent snow formation through riming or ice nucleation by other species and aggregation/accretion of ice particles. Applying deposition fields from these aerosol models in offline snow and sea-ice simulations, we calculate that 32?€?73 % of BC in global surface snow resides within ice grains. This fraction is smaller than the within-hydrometeor deposition fraction because meltwater flux preferentially re- moves internal BC, while sublimation and freezing within snowpack expose internal BC. Incorporating the DEMA into a global climate model, we simulate increases in BC/snow","We have used optical calculations, column radiation model- ing, and global aerosol/snow/climate modeling to quantify plausible ranges of the increase in solar energy absorption associated with BC inclusions in snow grains. Applying the dynamic effective medium approximation (DEMA) (Stroud and Pan, 1978; Chy??lek and Srivastava, 1983) we showed that the 460 nm effective mass absorption cross-section of BC increases by a factor of ???1.8?€?2.1 for ranges of BC inclu- sion size distribution, volume fraction, and snow effective radius expected for natural snow surfaces. BC effective ra- dius introduces the most variability in this enhancement, and is not accounted for with the Maxwell-Garnett and Brugge- man approximations. Various aerosol-cloud interactions can produce multiple internal BC inclusions in precipitating ice hydrometeors, with riming likely the most efficient mecha- nism. We apply two state-of-the-art aerosol-climate models to simulate global within-hydrometeor BC deposition frac- tions of 71?€?83 %, averaged temporally over snow and sea-ice surfaces. The simulated global-mean fraction of BC residing within ice grains of surface snow is 32?€?73 %, smaller than the global deposition fraction because meltwater scavenging, sublimation, and freezing of liquid water preferentially re- move internal BC or transfer it to the external state. Applying a parameterization of the DEMA suitable for global climate models, we calculate that these internal BC concentrations increase the global BC/snow radiative forcing by 34?€?86 % relative to paired control simulations that apply external op- tical properties to all BC. We believe that uncertainty in this forward-derived estimate arises more from uncertain repre- sentation of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions than of optical characteristics of BC/ice composites. To our knowl- edge there are no measurements of the relative mass and number concentrations of BC particles within and external to snow grains, but simple arguments considering measured BC mass concentrations and BC/ice particle sizes demonstrate that the number of BC particles per ice grain ranges from 0.05?€?109. In addition to the melt, freeze and sublimation pro- cesses we considered, snow metamorphism likely decreases the proportion of internal BC with time, but simulations with a dry snow aging model show that curvature-driven vapor diffusion does not significantly alter this fraction during the BC lifetime of radiative influence in snow. This modeling study demonstrates that black carbon in snowpack absorbs substantially more solar radiation because of its inclusion in ice grains.",[]

Estimated range of black carbon dry deposition and the related snow albedo reduction over Himalayan glaciers during dry premonsoon periods,,"In this work, we have estimated the possible uncertainty range of BCDs from different vd and global model outputs. The estimated possible range on BCD and related snow albedo reductions are important in both atmospheric chemistry and climate studies for the Himalayan region. We hope to provide useful data on BCD discussion over Himalayan glaciers due to the significant emissions of BC from open biomass burning and other anthropogenic sources in the region. Currently we do not intend to and cannot, determine the accurate BCD values and snow albedo reductions because there are no observations in details at the southern slope of the Hima- layas for comparison and validation. However, we were able to determine the possible range of BCD and its snow albedo reduc- tions over Himalayan glaciers at this stage of our study. Our results suggest that incorrect specification of surface roughness type such as vegetated surface over the grid point, including glaciers and strong surface wind in regional or global model, cause faster vd and larger amounts BCD over the glaciers. Hence, surface roughness parameter and wind speed are the most critical factor in deter- mining the BCD rates over Himalayan glaciers. The differences arising from BCD rates will eventually lead to further, wider differences on the estimates of glacier retreats over Himalayan and Tibetan regions in global or regional modeling studies. How to estimate vd more accurately at the grid point, which includes snow cover or glacier surface, is the key to assess glacier retreats or seasonal snow melt timings, in terms of the debris-covered area, snow darkening effect due to climate and environmental changes, using climate models. Model projections on glacier retreat, need to include estimates of uncertainties from key factors contributing to glacial mass balance change such as precipitation, wind, debris- covered area, snow aging, solar absorbing impurities in snow (i.e., BC, dust, organic matters, and snow algae), anthropogenic effects from atmospheric heating by the absorbing aerosols, and global warming (e.g., Takeuchi et al., 2001; IPCC, 2007; Flanner et al., 2007, 2009; Fujita, 2008; Lau et al., 2010; Scherler et al., 2011; Yasunari et al., 2011; Aoki et al., 2011).",[]
Estimates of global terrestrial isoprene emissions using MEGAN Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature,"Abstract. Reactive gases and aerosols are produced by ter- restrial ecosystems, processed within plant canopies, and can then be emitted into the above-canopy atmosphere. Esti- mates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantita- tive earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of iso- prene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global cov- erage with ???1 km2 spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from mod- els and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission fac- tors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribu- tion. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is ???600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emis- sion estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate iso-","Global geographically-referenced estimates of isoprene emission are necessary for characterizing global carbon cy- cling, distributions of trace gases and aerosols and their radiative forcing, and investigations of regional air quality (Guenther, 2002; Geron et al., 1994; Sanderson et al., 2003). The isoprene emission rates recommended in the mid to late 1990s (e.g., Guenther et al., 1995; Pierce et al., 1998) were more than a factor of two greater than those previ- ously used in regional air quality models and global chem- istry and transport models (e.g., Zimmerman et al., 1979; Pierce and Waldruff, 1991; Muller, 1992). The higher iso- prene emission rates resulted in unrealistically high predic- tions of boundary layer isoprene and ozone concentrations when they were introduced into some chemistry and trans- port models (e.g., Houweling et al., 1998). This led to the de- velopment of global isoprene emission inventories that were based on the Guenther et al. (1995) geographical and sea- sonal emission distributions but included a scaling factor to uniformly reduce emissions by 20% or more (e.g., Houwel- ing et al., 1998; Poisson et al., 2000) or reduce isoprene emis- sions by as much as a factor of three in selected landscapes (Bey et al., 2001). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group on Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases (Ehhalt and Prather, 2001) recom- mended using a global isoprene emission rate that is 56% lower than the Guenther et al. (1995) estimates. This emis- sion reduction was used to produce chemistry and transport model simulations of CO and isoprene concentrations that were similar to observations. However, the poor model per- formance could have been due to factors other than isoprene emission rates. For example, deposition rates, chemical oxi- dation schemes, or boundary layer dynamics could have been responsible. The ability of other models (e.g., Granier et al., 2000; Sanderson et al., 2003) to simulate reasonable distri- butions of chemical constituents when using annual global isoprene emissions of ???500 Tg carbon (???570 Tg isoprene), indicates that the rates estimated by Guenther et al. (1995) and by MEGAN are not unrealistic. Future improvements in simulations of the relevant chemical, physical, and bio- logical processes in global chemistry and transport models may provide stronger constraints on isoprene emissions. At present, these models neither confirm nor disprove the va- lidity of the emission rates estimated by MEGAN. How- ever, top-down emission estimates based on satellite mea- surements of formaldehyde distributions (see Sect. 6.2) gen- erally agree with the emission rates estimated by MEGAN.",[]

European insitu snow measurements Practices and purposes,"Abstract: In-situ snow measurements conducted by European institutions for operational, research, and energy business applications were surveyed in the framework of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES1404, called ?€?A European network for a harmonised monitoring of snow for the benefit of climate change scenarios, hydrology, and numerical weather prediction?€?. Here we present the results of this survey, which was answered by 125 participants from 99 operational and research institutions, belonging to 38 European countries. The typologies of environments where the snow measurements are performed range from mountain to low elevated plains, including forests, bogs, tundra, urban areas, glaciers, lake ice, and sea ice. Of the respondents, 93% measure snow macrophysical parameters, such as snow presence, snow depth (HS), snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow density. These describe the bulk characteristics of the whole snowpack or of a snow layer, and they are the primary snow properties that are needed for most operational applications (such as hydrological monitoring, avalanche forecast, and weather forecast). In most cases, these measurements are done with manual methods, although for snow presence, HS, and SWE, automatized methods are also applied by some respondents. Parameters characterizing precipitating and suspended snow (such as the height of new snow, precipitation intensity, flux of drifting/blowing snow, and particle size distribution), some of which are crucial for the operational services, are measured by 74% of the respondents. Parameters characterizing the snow microstructural properties (such as the snow grain size and shape, and specific surface area), the snow electromagnetic properties (such as albedo, brightness temperature, and backscatter), and the snow composition (such as impurities and isotopes) are measured by 41%, 26%, and 13% of the respondents, respectively, mostly for research applications. The results of this survey are discussed from the perspective of the need of enhancing the efficiency and coverage of the in-situ observational network applying automatic and cheap measurement methods. Moreover, recommendations for the enhancement and harmonization of the observational network and measurement practices are provided.",,[]
Evaluating the Utah Energy Balance UEB snow model in the Noah landsurface model,"Abstract. Noah (version 2.7.1), the community land- surface model (LSM) of National Centers for Environmen- tal Predictions-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR), which is widely used to describe the land- surface processes either in stand-alone or in coupled land- atmospheric model systems, is recognized to underestimate snow?€?water equivalent (SWE). Noah?€?s SWE bias can be at- tributed to its simple snow sub-model, which does not ef- fectively describe the physical processes during snow ac- cumulation and melt period. To improve SWE simulation in the Noah LSM, the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snow model is implemented in Noah to test alternate snow surface temperature and snowmelt outflow schemes. Snow surface temperature was estimated using the force-restore method and snowmelt event is regulated by accounting for the in- ternal energy of the snowpack. The modified Noah?€?s SWE simulations are compared with the SWE observed at Cali- fornia?€?s NRCS SNOTEL stations for 7 water years: 2002?€? 2008, while the model?€?s snow surface temperature is veri- fied with observed surface-temperature data at an observa- tion site in Utah. The experiments show that modification in Noah?€?s snow process substantially reduced SWE estimation bias while keeping the simplicity of the Noah LSM. The re- sults suggest that the model did not benefit from the alternate temperature representation but primary improvement can be attributed to the substituted snowmelt process.","The Noah LSM has been identified to under predict snow?€? water equivalent throughout the snow season and melt away all the snow early in spring. The control model simulates snowpack as a single layer and estimates the snow surface temperature based on the energy flux on the snow surface and the air temperature above the snow surface. When the snow- pack is at freezing temperature (0 ???C), snow starts to melt. In reality, snow temperature is not the only determining factor for snowmelt. To begin snow melting, the entire snowpack is required to be isothermal and the modified Noah model, like UEB model, determines this by accounting for internal energy of the snowpack. This melt water does not instantly become runoff but remains within the warm snowpack up to the liquid-water holding capacity. Once this water-holding capacity is exceeded, snowmelt becomes runoff.",[]

The correlation coefficient is 0.87 (R2 = 0.76) for red band and 0.84 (R-square = 0.71) for NIR band over clear sky pixels on land if both full inversion and magnitude inversions are considered. The biases are within 0.012 and RMSE are less than 0.025 for both red and NIR bands of full inversions andmagni- tude inversions (Table 5). The number of full inversions pixels is 117,966 while there are only 919 pixels of the magnitude inversions. The correlation coefficient of the magnitude inversions for the NIR is actually a little larger than the values achieved from just full inversions. However, the bias and RMSE of the magnitude inversions are all much worse than the full inversions. 5. Conclusions",[]
Evaluation of radar multiple scattering effects in CloudSat configuration,"Abstract. MonteCarlo simulations have been performed to evaluate the importance of multiple scattering effects in co- and cross-polar radar returns for 94 GHz radars in Cloudsat and airborne configurations. Thousands of vertically struc- tured profiles derived from some different cloud resolving models are used as a test-bed. Mie theory is used to de- rive the single scattering properties of the atmospheric hy- drometeors. Multiple scattering effects in the co-polar chan- nel (reflectivity enhancement) are particularly elusive, espe- cially in airborne configuration. They can be quite consis- tent in satellite configurations, like CloudSat, especially in regions of high attenuation and in the presence of highly forward scattering layers associated with snow and graupel particles. When the cross polar returns are analysed [but note that CloudSat does not measure any linear depolariza- tion ratio (LDR hereafter)], high LDR values appear both in space and in airborne configurations. The LDR signatures are footprints of multiple scattering effects; although depo- larization values as high as ???5 dB can be generated including non-spherical particles in single scattering modelling, multi- ple scattering computations can produce values close to com- plete depolarization (i.e. LDR=0 dB). Our simulated LDR profiles from an air-borne platform well reproduce, in a sim- ple frame, some experimental observations collected during the Wakasa Bay experiment. Since LDR instrumental uncer- tainties were not positively accounted for during that exper- iment, more focused campaigns with air-borne polarimetric radar are recommended. Multiple scattering effects can be important for CloudSat applications like rainfall and snow- fall retrievals since single scattering based algorithms will be otherwise burdened by positive biases.",The relevance of MS effects has been evaluated for the CloudSat configuration both for reflectivity enhancement and for the LDR signal (although such a quantity is not measured in the actual Cloud Profiling Radar of CloudSat). The sim- plified study conducted on a uniform layer reveals that large scattering optical thickness and asymmetry parameters are key factors in enhancing MS effects.,['Wakasa Bay']
Evaluation of Sentinel2A surface reflectance derived using Sen2Cor in North America,"Abstract?€?Surface reflectance can be derived from satellite mea- surements for the top of atmosphere and provides an important dataset for monitoring land change reliably. In this study, the Sentinel-2A surface reflectance was generated using the Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (Sen2Cor) processor. To evaluate this dataset, surface data at 40 sites of the aerosol robotic network over North America from January 2016 to August 2017 were collected and processed. The surface reflectance reference was derived from the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum?€? vector (6SV) code. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT), water va- por, surface reflectance, and three spectral indices generated by Sen2Cor were evaluated using the metrics including the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (A, P, and U). The results show that due to the limitations of Sen2Cor aerosol retrieval algorithm, the Sentinel-2A AOT was significantly overestimated, with the relative accuracy over 160%. The Sen2Cor surface reflectance is generally overestimated, especially for the bright pixels, except for the cirrus band. For the 12 Sentinel-2A bands, the mean values of relative A, P, and U are 4.15%, 13.44%, and 14.92%, respectively. Among the three spectral indices, the normalized difference vegetation index performs best, with a correlation coefficient of 0.973 against the surface data. Furthermore, the Sen2Cor surface reflectance was compared with other satellite products. The mean correlation co- efficient between Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 surface reflectance is found to be 0.761. This study suggests that a better AOT retrieval is critical for improvement of Sen2Cor in the future.",,['North America']
Evaluation of spaceborne Lband radiometer measurements for terrestrial freezethaw retrievals in Canada,"Abstract?€?The landscape freeze/thaw (F/T) state has an impor- tant impact on the surface energy balance, carbon fluxes, and hydrologic processes; the timing of spring melt is linked to active layer dynamics in permafrost areas. L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave emission could allow the monitoring of surface state dynamics due to its sensitivity to the pronounced permittivity difference between frozen and thawed soil. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the per- formance of both Aquarius and soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) L-band passive microwave measurements using a polar- ization ratio (PR)-based algorithm for landscape F/T monitoring. Weekly L-band satellite observations are compared with a large set of reference data at 48 sites across Canada spanning three environments: 1) tundra; 2) boreal forest; and 3) prairies. The reference data include in situ measurements of soil temperature (Tsoil) and air temperature (Tair), and moderate resolution imag- ing spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and snow cover area (SCA) products. Results show generally good agreement between L-band F/T detection and the surface state estimated from four reference datasets. The best apparent accu- racies for all seasons are obtained using Tair as the reference. Aquarius radiometer 2 (incidence angle of 39.6???) data give the best accuracies (90.8%), while for SMOS, using the Aquarius temporal characteristics, the best results (87.8% of accuracy) are obtained at higher incidence angles (55??????60???). The F/T algorithm iden- tifies both freeze onset and end with a delay of about 1 week in tundra and 2 weeks in forest and prairies, when compared to Tair. The analysis shows a stronger F/T signal at tundra sites due to the typically clean transitions between consistently frozen and thawed conditions (and vice versa) and the absence of surface vegetation. Results in the prairies were poorer because of the influence of",,['Canada']
Evaluation of the MODIS MOD10A1 daily snow albedo product over the Greenland ice sheet,Received 23 January 2006; received in revised form 14 June 2006; accepted 19 June 2006 Abstract,This paper provides an evaluation of the performance of the beta-test MODIS daily albedo product (e.g. MOD10A1 and MYD10A1) using in situ data collected in Greenland during 2004. Results indicate an overall RMS error of 0.067 for the Terra instrument (MOD10A1) and an RMS error of 0.075 on Aqua (MYD10A1) through comparisons with in situ observa- tions at five automatic weather stations in Greenland. The Terra- derived daily albedo have a correlation coefficient of 0.79 while the Aqua daily albedo observations are slightly less correlated with the automatic weather station (AWS) data (r=0.77).,"['Greenland.', 'Greenland']"

Evidence for exposed water ice in the Moons south polar regions from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ultraviolet albedo and temperature measurements,,"Observational evidence from Diviner surface temperature mea- surements and LAMP ultraviolet albedo spectra is consistent with the presence of exposed water frost near the lunar south pole, with a distribution controlled by temperature. For locations with annual maximum temperatures Tmax < ???110 K, we find a strong correlation between decreasing annual maximum temperature and: (a) decreasing Lyman-a albedo, (b) decreasing ?€??€?on-band?€??€? (129.57?€?155.57 nm) albedo, and (c) increasing ?€??€?off-band?€??€? (155.57?€?189.57 nm) albedo. All of these features are consistent with the UV spectrum of water ice, and are expected for water ice layers >???100 nm in thickness. High regolith porosity, which would darken the surface at all wavelengths, cannot alone explain the observed spectral variations with temperature. Given the observed LAMP off-band/on-band albedo ratios at a spatial scale of 250 m, the range of water ice concentrations within the cold traps with Tmax < 110 K is ???0.1?€?2.0% by mass, if the ice is inti- mately mixed with dry regolith. If pure water ice is exposed instead, then up to ???10% of the surface area in some 250-m regions may be ice-covered. Note that these abundance estimates assume a two-component mixture, and could be in error if other volatiles or minerals are present in addition to water ice and highlands regolith.",[]
Evidence of mineral dust altering cloud microphysics and precipitation,"Abstract. Multi-platform and multi-sensor observations are employed to investigate the impact of mineral dust on cloud microphysical and precipitation processes in mesoscale con- vective systems. For a given convective strength, small hy- drometeors were more prevalent in the stratiform rain regions with dust than in those regions that were dust free. Evidence of abundant cloud ice particles in the dust sector, particu- larly at altitudes where heterogeneous nucleation of mineral dust prevails, further supports the observed changes of pre- cipitation. The consequences of the microphysical effects of the dust aerosols were to shift the precipitation size spectrum from heavy precipitation to light precipitation and ultimately suppressing precipitation.",Cloud systems are primarily controlled by large-scale dy- namics and thermodynamics and modulated by microphys- ical processes. The impact of the latter process is extremely uncertain but can be quite profound. In this study we used multi-platform and multi-sensor observations to investigate,[]

Exposure to cobalt chromium dust and lung disorders in dental technicians,"Abstract Background - Dental technician's pneu- moconiosis is a dust-induced fibrotic lung disease of fairly recent origin. This study was carried out to estimate its occurrence in Sweden. Methods - Thirty seven dental technicians in central and south eastern Sweden with at least five years ofexposure to dust from cobalt chromium molybdenum (CoCrMo) alloys, identified by postal survey, agreed to undergo chest radiography and as- sessment oflung function and exposure to inorganic dust. Results - Six subjects (16%; 95% con- fidence interval 6% to 23%) showed radio- logical evidence of dental technician's pneumoconiosis. The lung function of the study group was reduced compared with historical reference material. With local exhaust ventilation dust levels were gen- erally low, whereas in dental laboratories without such equipment high levels of dust, particularly cobalt, were found. Conclusions - Pneumoconiosis may result from exposure to inorganic dust in the manufacturing of CoCrMo-based dental constructions. It is possible to reduce this hazard substantially by local exhaust vent- ilation. (Thorax 1995;50:769-772)",,['Sweden']

Other measured nitrogen species showed no significant fluxes which may be in part due to the measurement uncertainties and long integration times of the used denuder technique, and atmospheric tur- bulence and mixing. These HNO3 fluxes may be due to the reaction of HNO3 with sea salt contained in the snow, and especially NaCl, or may be simply uptake of HNO3 by ice, which is alkaline because of the sea salt in our marine envi- ronment.","['EU', 'Svalbard']"

Formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their growth to soota review of chemical reaction pathways,"The generation by combustion processes of airborne species of current health concern such as polycyclic aromatic hydro- carbons (PAH) and soot particles necessitates a detailed understanding of chemical reaction pathways responsible for their formation. The present review discusses a general scheme of PAH formation and sequential growth of PAH by reactions with stable and radical species, including single-ring aromatics, other PAH and acetylene, followed by the nucleation or inception of small soot particles, soot growth by coagulation and mass addition from gas phase species, and carbonization of the particulate material. Experimental and theoretical tools which have allowed the achievement of deeper insight into the corresponding chemical processes are presented. The significant roles of propargyl (C3H3) and cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) radicals in the formation of first aromatic rings in combustion of aliphatic fuels are discussed. Detailed kinetic modeling of well-defined combustion systems, such as premixed flames, for which sufficient experimental data for a quantitative understanding are available, is of increasing importance. Reliable thermodynamic and kinetic property data are also required for meaningful conclusions, and computational techniques for their determination are presented. Routes of ongoing and future research leading to more detailed experimental data as well as computational approaches for the exploration of elementary reaction steps and the description of systems of increasing complexity are discussed. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

From observation to the quantification of snow processes with a timelapse camera network,,"The study highlighted the usefulness of a distributed network of standard digital time-lapse cameras for snow observations in mesoscale mountain catchments with exemplary datasets. A simple technical modification related to the power supply of the cameras is needed to run the standard digital cameras autonomous at any location in the field. The presented exper- imental design is an appropriate technique to realise a con- tinuous observation of the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of key aspects of a seasonal snow cover through- out a mesoscale catchment. The method is easy to accom- plish, low-cost and provides useful data about snow depth and snow albedo as well as important snow processes such as snow interception and state of precipitation. Furthermore, the spatially distributed design of the camera network pro- vides reliable continuous information for the identification of the snow line during winter precipitation events and the in- terpretation of snowmelt runoff hydrographs. The time-laps cameras could also be used for other applications where vis- ible information could provide useful information of its own or together with additional observations.",[]

Glacial ecosystems,"Abstract. There is now compelling evidence that microbially mediated reactions impart a significant effect upon the dynamics, composition, and abundance of nutrients in glacial melt water. Consequently, we must now consider ice masses as ecosystem habitats in their own right and address their diversity, functional potential, and activity as part of alpine and polar environments. Although such research is already underway, its fragmentary nature provides little basis for developing modern concepts of glacier ecology. This paper therefore provides a much-needed framework for development by reviewing the physical, biogeochemical, and microbiological characteristics of microbial habitats that have been identified within glaciers and ice sheets. Two key glacial ecosystems emerge, one inhabiting the glacier surface (the supraglacial ecosystem) and one at the ice-bed interface (the subglacial ecosystem). The supraglacial ecosystem is characterized by a diverse consortium of microbes (usually bacteria, algae, phytoflagellates, fungi, viruses and occasional rotifers, tardigrades, and diatoms) within the snowpack, supraglacial streams, and melt pools (cryoconite holes). The subglacial system is dominated by aerobic/anaerobic bacteria and most probably viruses in basal ice/till mixtures and subglacial lakes. A third, so-called englacial ecosystem is also described, but it is demonstrated that conditions within glacier ice are sufficient to make metabolic activity and its impact upon nutrient dynamics negligible at the glacier scale. Consideration of the surface and internal heat balances of the glacier show that all glacial",,[]
Glacier melt a review of processes and their modelling,"Abstract: Modelling ice and snow melt is of large practical and scientific interest, including issues such as water resource management, avalanche forecasting, glacier dynamics, hydrology and hydrochemistry, as well as the response of glaciers to climate change. During the last few decades, a large variety of melt models have been developed, ranging from simple temperature-index to sophisticated energy-balance models. There is a recent trend towards modelling with both high temporal and spatial resolution, the latter accomplished by fully distributed models. This review discusses the relevant processes at the surface-atmosphere interface, and their representation in melt models. Despite considerable advances in distributed melt modelling there is still a need to refine and develop models with high spatial and temporal resolution based on moderate input data requirements. While modelling of incoming radiation in mountain terrain is relatively accurate, modelling of turbulent fluxes and spatial and temporal variability in albedo constitute major uncertainties in current energy-balance melt models, and thus need further research.",,[]

Global millimeterwave precipitation retrievals trained with a cloudresolving numerical weather prediction model Part I Retrieval design,"Abstract?€?This paper develops a global precipitation rate re- trieval algorithm for the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), which observes 23?€?191 GHz. The algorithm was trained using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model (MM5) for 106 globally distributed storms that predicted brightness temper- atures consistent with those observed simultaneously by AMSU. Neural networks were trained to retrieve hydrometeor water- paths, peak vertical wind, and 15-min average surface precipita- tion rates for rain and snow at 15-km resolution at all viewing angles. Different estimators were trained for land and sea, where surfaces classed as snow or ice were generally excluded from this paper. Surface-sensitive channels were incorporated by using lin- ear combinations [principal components (PCs)] of their brightness temperatures that were observed to be relatively insensitive to the surface, as determined by visual examination of global images of each brightness temperature spectrum PC. This paper also demonstrates that multiple scattering in high microwave albedo clouds may help explain the observed consistency for a global set of 122 storms between AMSU-observed 50?€?191-GHz brightness temperature distributions and corresponding distributions pre- dicted using a cloud-resolving mesoscale NWP model (MM5) and a two-stream radiative transfer model that models icy hydrometeors as spheres with frequency-dependent densities.

Grain size sensitive deformation mechanisms in naturally deformed peridotites,"Microstructural analyses of peridotite mylonites from the oceanic lithosphere indicate that shear localization results from the combined effects of grain size reduction, grain boundary sliding and second phase pinning during deformation. The pinning effect, combined with experimental flow laws for olivine, suggests that a permanent transition from dislocation creep processes to diffusion creep occurs. This rheological transition provides a mechanism for long term weakening of the lithosphere for rocks deforming in the brittle?€?ductile regime. In addition, our results support the hypothesis that a transition to diffusion creep promotes the randomization of pre-existing lattice preferred orientations, which would reduce seismic anisotropy. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Greenhouse warming and the 21st century hydroclimate of southwestern North America,,"Conclusions Models project that SWNAwill dry in the current century, with the drying reaching the amplitude of past multiyear droughts by mid- century. The drying is driven by a winter decrease in precipitation associated with increased moisture divergence by the mean flow, largely a consequence of rising humidity in a divergent flow, and reduced moisture convergence by transient eddies. The latter is associated with a strengthening and poleward spread of the winter Pacific storm track. These changes arise as a consequence of over- all global warming and its impact on storm track location and in- tensity. However, SWNA hydroclimate is strongly influenced by natural decadal variability in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Our best estimates, which are quite uncertain, are that modes of Pacific and Atlantic decadal variability are currently in phases that promote drought in SWNA and these oceanic conditions can be expected to last for years to come. Given that, in addition, anthropogenic drying will strengthen as the years go by, this com- bination of natural variability and forced change make it unlikely","['North America', 'Atlantic', 'Pacific']"

Halogen activation via interactions with environmental ice and snow in the polar lower troposphere and other regions,"Abstract. The role of ice in the formation of chemically ac- tive halogens in the environment requires a full understand- ing because of its role in atmospheric chemistry, including controlling the regional atmospheric oxidizing capacity in specific situations. In particular, ice and snow are important for facilitating multiphase oxidative chemistry and as media upon which marine algae live. This paper reviews the na- ture of environmental ice substrates that participate in halo- gen chemistry, describes the reactions that occur on such sub- strates, presents the field evidence for ice-mediated halogen activation, summarizes our best understanding of ice-halogen activation mechanisms, and describes the current state of modeling these processes at different scales.

Heterogeneous ice nucleation on atmospheric aerosols a review of results from laboratory experiments,"Abstract. A small subset of the atmospheric aerosol popu- lation has the ability to induce ice formation at conditions under which ice would not form without them (heteroge- neous ice nucleation). While no closed theoretical descrip- tion of this process and the requirements for good ice nu- clei is available, numerous studies have attempted to quan- tify the ice nucleation ability of different particles empiri- cally in laboratory experiments. In this article, an overview of these results is provided. Ice nucleation ?€?onset?€? conditions for various mineral dust, soot, biological, organic and ammo- nium sulfate particles are summarized. Typical temperature- supersaturation regions can be identified for the ?€?onset?€? of ice nucleation of these different particle types, but the vari- ous particle sizes and activated fractions reported in different studies have to be taken into account when comparing results obtained with different methodologies. When intercompar- ing only data obtained under the same conditions, it is found that dust mineralogy is not a consistent predictor of higher or lower ice nucleation ability. However, the broad major- ity of studies agrees on a reduction of deposition nucleation by various coatings on mineral dust. The ice nucleation ac- tive surface site (INAS) density is discussed as a simple and empirical normalized measure for ice nucleation activity. For most immersion and condensation freezing measurements on mineral dust, estimates of the temperature-dependent INAS density agree within about two orders of magnitude. For de- position nucleation on dust, the spread is significantly larger, but a general trend of increasing INAS densities with increas- ing supersaturation is found. For soot, the presently available results are divergent. Estimated average INAS densities are high for ice-nucleation active bacteria at high subzero tem- peratures. At the same time, it is shown that INAS densities","In this compilation of results from six decades of laboratory experiments of heterogeneous ice nucleation, it has become obvious that many fundamental questions in this field are yet unsolved. Observed onset conditions for heterogeneous ice nucleation spread over large ranges of temperature and ice supersaturation, due to differences in methodology and non- standardized reported variables. Normalization by activated fraction and particle surface area (i.e. estimates of the INAS density) leads to some convergence between different meth- ods, but even for materials which are assumed to have a con- stant composition (e.g. ATD, kaolinite), the agreement is not satisfactory yet. Possible reasons could be impurities in the samples, different methods for the surface area determina- tion, or instrumental biases.",[]
Highaccuracy measurements of snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function at visible and NIR wavelengthscomparison with modelling results,"Abstract. High-accuracy measurements of snow Bidirec- tional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) were per- formed for four natural snow samples with a spectrogonio- radiometer in the 500?€?2600 nm wavelength range. These measurements are one of the first sets of direct snow BRDF values over a wide range of lighting and viewing geometry. They were compared to BRDF calculated with two optical models. Variations of the snow anisotropy factor with light- ing geometry, wavelength and snow physical properties were investigated. Results show that at wavelengths with small penetration depth, scattering mainly occurs in the very top layers and the anisotropy factor is controlled by the phase function. In this condition, forward scattering peak or dou- ble scattering peak is observed. In contrast at shorter wave- lengths, the penetration of the radiation is much deeper and the number of scattering events increases. The anisotropy factor is thus nearly constant and decreases at grazing ob- servation angles. The whole dataset is available on demand from the corresponding author.","This paper presents a large set of direct measurements of BRDF for different types of snow. The comparison with modelled BRDF and results in literature allow to explain the main BRDF variations as a function of viewing and lighting angles, wavelength, size and shape of grain.",[]

A recently developed algorithm (Zhang et al., 2005) has been applied to deconvolve the mass spectra of organic aerosols acquired with the Aerosol Mass Spectrom- eter (AMS) in Pittsburgh during September 2002. The re- sults are used here to characterize the mass concentrations, size distributions, and mass spectra of hydrocarbon-like and oxygenated organic aerosol (HOA and OOA, respectively). HOA accounts for 34% of the measured organic aerosol mass and OOA accounts for 66%. The mass concentra- tions of HOA demonstrate a prominent diurnal profile that peaks in the morning during the rush hour and decreases with the rise of the boundary layer. The diurnal profile of OOA is relatively flat and resembles those of SO2???4 and NH+4 . The size distribution of HOA shows a distinct ul- trafine mode that is commonly associated with fresh emis- sions while OOA is generally concentrated in the accumu- lation mode and appears to be mostly internally mixed with the inorganic ions, such as SO2???4 and NH","This paper reports the mass concentrations, size distribu- tions, and temporal variations of hydrocarbon-like and oxy- genated organic aerosols in Pittsburgh during September 2002 and discusses the possible sources and processes of these two aerosol components.

Hydrological response of snowpack under rainonsnow events a field study,"The hydrological response of rain-on-snow events has been studied on a plot scale at 2640 m altitude in the Austrian Alps. Three artificial rain events with different intensities and durations were simulated over two snow plots on a natural snowpack and the behaviour of emerging outflow was examined. Measurements of meteorological parameters, soil temperature and snowpack properties were also made. The investigations show that the impeding characteristics of the ice layers more than doubled the storage capacity of the snowpack. The speed of water movement was estimated to be about 6 m h???1 when the snow pack was fully saturated. Accelerated metamorphism under saturated conditions and preferential flow paths created owing to uneven snow surface caused by the impact of intense rain over the snow surface, are understood to be responsible for the high speed of water flow. This indicates that heavy rain water moves several times faster than the natural snowmelt under non- rainy conditions. Moreover, under rainy conditions, natural snowmelt also percolates faster along with rain water. Observations of the time of arrival of runoff, t a and time to equilibrium concentra- tion of liquid water in snow, te, for different rain events indicate that after conditioning of the snowpack, a significant reduction of rain intensity (by half in the present study) is not able to change the distribution of runoff much; fast response of water was also observed under reduced rain- intensity. Another important aspect of the snowpack worth noting was that most of the input appeared as runoff. This stage of snowpack with high conductivity is found to be responsible for the production of high streamflows. Heavy rain either with snowmelt or alone can generate floods under such conditions. The importance of the role of rain water in conditioning the snowpack to yield maximum and fast runoff is due much more to input rather than to rain-induced snow melt. ??? 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","This paper describes the storage and transmission characteristics of water through snow for rain-on-snow events and provides quantitative experimental data obtained from field investigation in the Austrian alpine region at an altitude of 2640 m.

Impact of sea ice on the retrieval of waterleaving reflectance chlorophyll a concentration and inherent optical properties from satellite ocean color data,"Two physical phenomena by which satellite remotely sensed ocean color data are contaminated by sea ice at high latitudes are described through simulations and observations: (1) the adjacency effect that occurs along sea ice margins and (2) the sub-pixel contamination by a small amount of sea ice within an ocean pixel. The signal at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) was simulated using the 6S radiative transfer code that allows modeling of the adjacency effect for various types of sea ice surrounding an open water area. In situ sea ice reflectance spectra used in the simulations were measured prior to and during the melt period as part of the 2004 Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES). For sub-pixel contamination, the TOA signal was simulated for various surface reflectances obtained by linear mixture of both sea ice and water-leaving reflectances (??w). The standard atmospheric correction algorithm was then applied to the simulated TOA spectra to retrieve ??w spectra from which chlorophyll a concentrations (CHL) and inherent optical properties (IOPs) were derived. The adjacency effect was associated with large errors (N0.002) in the retrieval of ??w as far as 24 km from an ice edge in the blue part of the spectrum (443 nm). Therefore, for moderate to high CHL (N0.5 mg m???3), any pixel located within a distance of ???10?€?20 km from the ice edge were unreliable.

The authors found that during April?€?May?€?June, the deposition of LAAs on snow led to a reduction in surface albedo, initiating a sequence of feedback processes, starting with increased net surface solar radiation, rapid snowmelt in the HTP and warming of the surface and upper troposphere, followed by enhanced low-level southwesterlies and increased dust loading over the Himalayas?€?Indo-Gangetic Plain. The warming was amplified by increased dust aerosol heating, and subsequently amplified by latent heating from enhanced precipitation over the Himalayan foothills and northern India, via the elevated heat pump (EHP) effect during June?€?July?€?August. The reduced snow cover in the HTP anchored the enhanced heating over the Tibetan Plateau and its southern slopes, in conjunction with an enhancement of the Tibetan Anticyclone, and the development of an anomalous Rossby wave train over East Asia, leading to a weakening of the subtropical westerly jet, and northward displacement and intensification of the Mei-Yu rain belt.

Impact of snow deposition on major and trace element concentrations and elementary fluxes in surface waters of the Western Siberian Lowland across a 1700 ,"Abstract. In order to better understand the chemical compo- sition of snow and its impact on surface water hydrochem- istry in the poorly studied Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), the surface layer of snow was sampled in February 2014 across a 1700 km latitudinal gradient (ca. 56.5 to 68??? N). We aimed at assessing the latitudinal effect on both dissolved and particulate forms of elements in snow and quantifying the impact of atmospheric input to element storage and ex- port fluxes in inland waters of the WSL. The concentration of dissolved+colloidal (< 0.45 ??m) Fe, Co, Cu, As and La increased by a factor of 2 to 5 north of 63??? N compared to southern regions. The pH and dissolved Ca, Mg, Sr, Mo and U in snow water increased with the rise in concentrations of particulate fraction (PF). Principal component analyses of major and trace element concentrations in both dissolved and particulate fractions revealed two factors not linked to the lat- itude. A hierarchical cluster analysis yielded several groups of elements that originated from alumino-silicate mineral matrix, carbonate minerals and marine aerosols or belong- ing to volatile atmospheric heavy metals, labile elements from weatherable minerals and nutrients.

Implementation and evaluation of prognostic representations of the optical diameter of snow in the SURFEXISBACrocus detailed snowpack model,"Abstract. In the SURFEX/ISBA-Crocus multi-layer snow- pack model, the snow microstructure has up to now been characterised by the grain size and by semi-empirical shape variables which cannot be measured easily in the field or linked to other relevant snow properties. In this work we in- troduce a new formulation of snow metamorphism directly based on equations describing the rate of change of the op- tical diameter (dopt). This variable is considered here to be equal to the equivalent sphere optical diameter, which is in- versely proportional to the specific surface area (SSA). dopt thus represents quantitatively some of the geometric charac- teristics of a porous medium. Different prognostic rate equa- tions of dopt, including a re-formulation of the original Cro- cus scheme and the parameterisations from Taillandier et al.

We focused especially on results in terms of SSA. In addition, we tested the impact of the dif- ferent formulations on the simulated density profile, the to- tal snow height, the snow water equivalent (SWE) and the surface albedo.

In situ continuous visible and nearinfrared spectroscopy of an alpine snowpack,"Abstract. Snow spectral albedo in the visible/near-infrared range has been continuously measured during a winter sea- son at Col de Porte alpine site (French Alps; 45.30??? N, 5.77??? E; 1325 m a.s.l.). The evolution of such alpine snow- pack is complex due to intensive precipitation, rapid melt events and Saharan dust deposition outbreaks. This study highlights that the resulting intricate variations of spectral albedo can be successfully explained by variations of the fol- lowing snow surface variables: specific surface area (SSA) of snow, effective light-absorbing impurities content, presence of liquid water and slope. The methodology developed in this study disentangles the effect of these variables on snow spec- tral albedo. The presence of liquid water at the snow sur- face results in a spectral shift of the albedo from which melt events can be identified with an occurrence of false detection rate lower than 3.5 %. Snow SSA mostly impacts spectral albedo in the near-infrared range. Impurity deposition mostly impacts the albedo in the visible range but this impact is very dependent on snow SSA and surface slope. Our work thus demonstrates that the SSA estimation from spectral albedo is affected by large uncertainties for a tilted snow surface and medium to high impurity contents and that the estimation of impurity content is also affected by large uncertainties, es- pecially for low values below 50 ng g???1 black carbon equiv- alent. The proposed methodology opens routes for retrieval of SSA, impurity content, melt events and surface slope from spectral albedo.

Incoming longwave radiation to melting snow observations sensitivity and estimation in northern environments,"At high latitudes, longwave radiation can provide similar, or higher, amounts of energy to snow than shortwave radiation due to the low solar elevation (cosine effect and increased scattering due to long atmospheric path lengths). This effect is magnified in mountains due to shading and longwave emissions from the complex topography. This study examines longwave irradiance at the snow surface in the Wolf Creek Research Basin, Yukon Territory, Canada (60??360N, 134??570W) during the springs of 2002 and 2004. Incoming longwave radiation was estimated from standard meteorological measurements by segregating radiation sources into clear sky, clouds and surrounding terrain. A sensitivity study was conducted to detect the atmospheric and topographic conditions under which emission from adjacent terrain significantly increases the longwave irradiance. The total incoming longwave radiation is more sensitive to sky view factor than to the temperature of the emitting terrain surfaces. Brutsaert?€?s equation correctly simulates the clear-sky irradiance for hourly time steps using temperature and humidity. Longwave emissions from clouds, which raised longwave radiation above that from clear skies by 16% on average, were best estimated using daily atmospheric shortwave transmissivity and hourly relative humidity. An independent test of the estimation procedure for a prairie site near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, indicated that the calculations are robust in late winter and spring conditions.

Incorporating the Torrance and Sparrow model of reflectance in uncalibrated photometric stereo,"Abstract Under the Lambertian reflectance model, uncalibrated pho- tometric stereo with unknown light sources is inherently ambiguous. In this paper, we consider the use of a more general reflectance model, namely the Torrance and Spar- row model, in uncalibrated photometric stereo. We demon- strate that this can not only resolve the ambiguity when the light sources are unknown, but can also result in more accu- rate surface reconstructions and can capture the reflectance properties of a large number of non-Lambertian surfaces. Our method uses single light source images with unknown lighting and no knowledge about the parameters of the re- flectance model. It can recover the 3-D shape of surfaces (up to the binary convex/concave ambiguity) together with their reflectance properties. We have successfully tested our algorithm on a variety of non-Lambertian surfaces demon- strating the effectiveness of our approach. In the case of human faces, the estimated skin reflectance has been shown to closely resemble the measured skin reflectance reported in the literature. We also demonstrate improved recognition results on 4050 images of 10 faces with variable lighting and viewpoint when the synthetic image-based representa- tions of the faces are generated using the surface recon- structions and reflectance properties recovered while as- suming the extended reflectance model.",,['Torrance']

Influence of annealing on physical properties of evaporated SnS films,"Abstract The effect of annealing on the composition, crystal structure, surface features and electro-optical properties of tin mono-sulfide (SnS) films, deposited by thermal evaporation at 300 ???C, has been studied. Elemental analysis of the films shows sulfur deficiency, which increases at higher annealing temperatures (Ta). The SnS structure in the as-deposited and annealed films remains orthorhombic. With an increase in Ta, the grain size and the surface roughness are reduced. The electrical resistivity also decreases with increasing Ta. The variation of activation energy and optical parameters with Ta has been explained by taking into account the degree of preferred orientation of the grains. The films annealed at 100 ???C show some unusual features compared to those annealed at other temperatures.","The present work has attempted a study of the physical properties of SnS films annealed at different temperatures.

Influence of Central Siberian SnowAlbedo Feedback on the Spring East Asian Dust Cycle and Connection With the Preceding Winter Arctic Oscillation,"Abstract The Asian dust cycle has significant effects on the climate and environment, while its spatiotemporal variability and change mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Reanalysis data from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2), data set are used to explore the spatiotemporal distribution of the East Asian dust cycle and possible reasons for the interannual variations. Based on the empirical orthogonal function analysis, the dominant mode of dust emissions from the East Asian deserts in the dust season (spring) shows that the Gobi Desert contributes most of the interannual variance of dust emissions in East Asia. The patterns of the regional circulation, temperature, and radiation are analyzed by regressing these variables against the principal component time series of the first empirical orthogonal function mode. The results show that the enhanced dust emissions are associated with a cyclonic circulation anomaly and cooling in the lower and middle troposphere over Central Siberia. The cooling is attributed to local snow-albedo and cloud-albedo feedbacks. The surface cooling is conducive to maintain the snow cover, whereas the cooling in themiddle troposphere is associated with the increase of the relative humidity and cloud cover. The increased snow and cloud cover reflect more shortwave radiation, tending to maintain or amplify the surface cooling. It is also found that the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation in winter initiates the surface cooling in the next spring and results in positive snow-albedo and cloud feedbacks in Central Siberia, eventually enhancing the East Asian dust cycle.",,"['Gobi Desert', 'Central Siberia.', 'Arctic Oscillation']"

Influence of grain shape on light penetration in snow,"Abstract. The energy budget and the photochemistry of a snowpack depend greatly on the penetration of solar radi- ation in snow. Below the snow surface, spectral irradiance decreases exponentially with depth with a decay constant called the asymptotic flux extinction coefficient. As with the albedo of the snowpack, the asymptotic flux extinction co- efficient depends on snow grain shape. While representing snow by a collection of spherical particles has been suc- cessful in the numerical computation of albedo, such a de- scription poorly explains the decrease of irradiance in snow with depth. Here we explore the limits of the spherical rep- resentation. Under the assumption of geometric optics and weak absorption by snow, the grain shape can be simply de- scribed by two parameters: the absorption enhancement pa- rameter B and the geometric asymmetry factor gG. Theoret- ical calculations show that the albedo depends on the ratio B/(1???gG) and the asymptotic flux extinction coefficient de- pends on the product B(1???gG). To understand the influence of grain shape, the values of B and gG are calculated for a variety of simple geometric shapes using ray tracing simu- lations. The results show that B and (1 ??? gG) generally co- vary so that the asymptotic flux extinction coefficient exhibits larger sensitivity to the grain shape than albedo. In particular it is found that spherical grains propagate light deeper than any other investigated shape. In a second step, we developed a method to estimate B from optical measurements in snow. A multi-layer, two-stream, radiative transfer model, with ex- plicit grain shape dependence, is used to retrieve values of the B parameter of snow by comparing the model to joint measurements of reflectance and irradiance profiles. Such measurements were performed in Antarctica and in the Alps yielding estimates of B between 0.8 and 2.0. In addition, val-","The present paper shows that the spherical assumption is in- appropriate to model irradiance profiles in snow. Indeed, the- oretical calculations as well as measurements point out that the absorption enhancement parameter B is greater for snow than for spheres. As a consequence, the geometric asymme- try factor gG in snow is probably lower than that of spheres, and modelled e-folding depth is overestimated when grains are assumed spherical, which is in agreement with observa- tions from the literature. Grain shape is highly variable with time and location (Colbeck, 1982), hence snow cannot be systematically represented by a collection of spheres for op- tical calculations. To account for the grain shape in optical radiative transfer models, such as those used in weather fore- cast and climate models, we need to further explore the rela- tionship between B and snow type or traditional snow grain shape (Fierz et al., 2009). To this end, future work should fo- cus on the systematic determination of B in laboratory and in the field. In addition, a method to determine gG should be developed which will require independent measurements of specific surface area.","['Alps', 'Antarctica']"
Influence of horizontal inhomogeneity on albedo and absorptivity of snow cover,Abstract?€?The variations of albedo and absorptivity of the snow cover are considered caused by the presence of the snow roughness in the form of sastrugi. The numerical modeling is carried out within the framework of statistical approach based on the analytic averaging of the radiative transfer equation and statistically homogeneous model on the basis of Poisson flows of points at the straight lines. The es- timates of the influence of 3D-effects of the rough surface are represented depending on optical and geometrical characteristics of sastrugi and on the illumination conditions. It is demonstrated that if the absorption by the snow particles is weak (the single scattering albedo w = 0.9999) the reflection of radi- ation by snow decreases by ~ 2?€?3% when the sastrugi appear. This effect is more significant in near infrared spectral region where w is below 0.99.,,[]

Insitu measurements of the mixing state and optical properties of soot with implications for radiative forcing estimates,,"Conclusions In this study, we have provided direct measurements of the optical and microphysical characteristics of atmospheric soot particles, showing how they can quickly evolve within an urban environment. Within 3 h after sunrise, photochemical activity results in the rapid conversion of fresh nonspherical soot to aged spherical coated soot particles, which become the dominant contributor to aerosol ab- sorption in the middle of the day. By the time soot reaches rural and remote locations, it will acquire even more secondary material because of the longer time spent in the atmosphere. The aged soot measured in Riverside contained significant coatings acquired during transport across the Los Angeles air basin compared with relatively fresh soot particles at the center of Mexico City. It is well-documented that the Mexico City basin is flushed out on a daily basis by favorable meteorological conditions. Thus, differ- ences in the meteorological conditions at the 2 urban locations resulted in both a larger absorption enhancement and a single scattering albedo for Riverside.

Insulation effects of Icelandic dust and volcanic ash on snow and ice,"Abstract In the Arctic region, Iceland is an important source of dust due to ash production from volcanic erup- tions. In addition, dust is resuspended from the surface into the atmosphere as several dust storms occur each year. During volcanic eruptions and dust storms, material is deposited on the glaciers where it influences their en- ergy balance. The effects of deposited volcanic ash on ice and snow melt were examined using laboratory and out- door experiments. These experiments were made during the snow melt period using two different ash grain sizes (1 ?? and 3.5 ??) from the Eyjafjallaj??kull 2010 eruption, collected on the glacier. Different amounts of ash were deposited on snow or ice, after which the snow properties and melt were measured. The results show that a thin ash layer increases the snow and ice melt but an ash layer exceeding a certain critical thickness caused insulation. Ash with 1 ?? in grain size insulated the ice below at a",,['Iceland']

Intercomparison and validation of snow albedo parameterization schemes in climate models,"Abstract Snow albedo is known to be crucial for heat exchange at high latitudes and high altitudes, and is also an important parameter in General Circulation Models (GCMs) because of its strong positive feedback prop- erties. In this study, seven GCM snow albedo schemes and a multiple linear regression model were intercom- pared and validated against 59 years of in situ data from Svalbard, the French Alps and six stations in the former Soviet Union. For each site, the significant meteoro- logical parameters for modeling the snow albedo were identified by constructing the 95% confidence intervals. The significant parameters were found to be: tempera- ture, snow depth, positive degree day and a dummy of snow depth, and the multiple linear regression model was constructed to include these. Overall, the inter- comparison showed that the modeled snow albedo var- ied more than the observed albedo for all models, and that the albedo was often underestimated. In addition, for several of the models, the snow albedo decreased at a faster rate or by a greater magnitude during the winter snow metamorphosis than the observed albedo. Both the temperature dependent schemes and the prognostic schemes showed shortcomings.","The overall goal of this work was not to determine a single ?€??€?best snow albedo parameterization scheme?€??€?. Instead the characteristics of the seven GCMs and the multiple linear regression model were investigated, and the models were intercompared with each other and with in situ validation data. Eight sites covering the northern hemisphere (Svalbard, the French Alps and six stations in the former Soviet Union) were used as validation data.",['French Alps']

Intercomparison of MODIS albedo retrievals and in situ measurements across the global FLUXNET network,,"ENF and EBF snow-free albedo do not show any significant season- al trend and monthly values are around 0.1. EBF do not show seasonal variation also at the global scale, while larger variability is observed for ENF in winter months. A clear seasonality is shown by DBF+MF and CRO, with higher values at the peak of the growing season, in line with the results of other in situ studies (Sellers et al., 1997). The seasonal pattern of GRA is the opposite, with a winter maximum in albedo. The increase of GRA albedo from August, observed both in MODIS and FLUXNET data, is probably due to vegetation senescence, with the increase of exposed soil and dead biomass and the drying of stalks and seeds during summer months. 4.

Interpretation of snow properties from imaging spectrometry,,"Amongnaturalmaterials at Earth's surface, snowhas a huge range of spectral reflectance values depending on its physical characteristics, primarily the grain size but also dust or soot content, organic substances such as algae, and liquid water. Understanding this variability is impor- tant because more than one billion people depend on melting snow or glaciers for their primary water resource. In the last three decades, we have seen a productive coupling between better measurements and models of the optical properties of snow and advances in remote sensing. Foremost among these has been the use of data from imaging spectrometers to interpret snow properties. The important properties we canmeasure are: fractional snow-covered area, grain size (expressed as the sphere with equivalent surface-to-volume ratio), liquid water content in the near-surface layer, concentration of snow algae, and radiative forcing caused by dust. From grain size and other impurities, spectral and broadband albedo can be estimated. All of these results with imaging spectrometry (applied to snow on Earth) have been verified with surface measurements or, in the case of fractional snow- covered area, with high-resolution aerial photography.",[]

Dust deposition at Talos Dome reflects the major climate changes occurring on a hemispheric scale during the last climatic transition, as sug- gested by the first-order variability of dust in the 1?€?5 ??m size range between 2 and 23 kyr BP. However, the contribution from local dust sources makes Talos Dome sensitive to re- gional atmospheric circulation changes, in particular, during warm climate periods, such as the end of Termination I and the Holocene.","['East Antarctica', 'Dome East Antarctica', 'Talos Dome', 'Talos Dome East Antarctica']"
Interprocedural dataflow analysis with ifdside and soot,"Abstract The IFDS and IDE frameworks by Reps, Horwitz and Sagiv are two general frameworks for the inter-procedural anal- ysis of data-flow problems with distributive flow functions over finite domains. Many data-flow problems do have dis- tributive flow functions and are thus expressible as IFDS or IDE problems, reaching from basic analyses like truly-live variables to complex analyses for problems from the current literature such as typestate and secure information-flow.","6. Conclusion We have presented our implementation of an IFDS/IDE solver in Soot, from a user perspective and in terms of impor- tant implementation details. Further, we have contrasted our implementation with an existing IFDS implementation in WALA. We hope that our solver implementation will serve as a basis for future collaborative research in the area of whole-program analysis. While not all analyses problems may fit the IFDS/IDE framework, the ones who do could benefit from mutual reuse and from additional performance optimizations applied to the solver itself.",[]

Intrinsic and extrinsic size effects in finegrained morphotropicphaseboundary lead zirconate titanate ceramics,,"Using carefully processed ceramic samples that are free of space-charge contributions, as indicated by the adherence to the Curie?€?Weiss relation, the grain-size variation in the range of 0.1?€?10 mm is shown to be sensitive to domain structural changes, which, in turn, limits the elastodielectric properties through the extrinsic contributions. The domain variants are limited in the ultrafine grain material; however, the relative domain density is increased, as indicated from the departure from the parabolic scaling of the mode of the domain size distribution and the mean of the grain size. The reduction in the variants lowers the saturation polarization and the piezoelectric coefficients and electromechanical coupling coefficient. The relative increase in dielectric loss with decreasing grain size could be explained only by the relative increase in domain density, as indicated by the smaller domain sizes.",[]

Investigation of a model inversion technique to estimate canopy biophysical variables from spectral and directional reflectance data,"Abstract ?€? The objective of this study was to assess the ability to estimate canopy biophysical variables from remote sensing data observed at the top of the canopy in several directions and wavebands within the visible-near infrared domain. The variables considered were the leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll content, the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy and the cover fraction. The SAIL radiative transfer model was inverted using a simple technique based on look-up-tables. The size of the look-up-table, and the number of its elements selected to get a distribution of the solution were first determined. The nadir reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands was consid- ered to evaluate the retrieval performances in terms of the distributions and co-distributions of the solutions. The opti- mal spectral and directional sampling to estimate the variables considered was investigated. Finally, the impact of spa- tial heterogeneity on the retrieval performances, the effect of the model assumptions used to generate the look-up table and the effect of radiometric noise were evaluated. These results were discussed in view of the definition of future satel- lites and the selection of the best measurement configuration for accurate estimation of canopy characteristics.",The performances of model inversion were first evaluated in the case where only limited radiomet- ric information was available.

Iodine speciation in rain snow and aerosols,"Abstract. Iodine oxides, such as iodate, should be the only thermodynamically stable sink species for iodine in the tro- posphere. However, field observations have increasingly found very little iodate and significant amounts of iodide and soluble organically bound iodine (SOI) in precipitation and aerosols. The aim of this study was to investigate io- dine speciation, including the organic fraction, in rain, snow, and aerosols in an attempt to further clarify aqueous phase iodine chemistry. Diurnal aerosol samples were taken with a 5 stage cascade impactor and a virtual impactor (PM2.5) from the Mace Head research station, Ireland, during sum- mer 2006. Rain was collected from Australia, New Zealand, Patagonia, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland and snow was obtained from Greenland, Germany, Switzerland, and New Zealand. Aerosols were extracted from the filters with water and all samples were analysed for total soluble iodine (TSI) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and iodine speciation was determined by coupling an ion chromatography unit to the ICP-MS. The median concentra- tion of TSI in aerosols from Mace Head was 222 pmol m???3","Atmospheric iodine chemistry is of increasing interest due to the nucleation of iodine gases to form new nucleation sized aerosols and its potential role in tropospheric ozone deple- tion. The nucleating aerosol species, as well as iodine taken up from the gas phase, should, thermodynamically, be iodine oxides such as I2O5 and HIO3. However, as shown here, io- dine oxides are the least abundant iodine species in accumu- lation and course mode aerosols, rain and snow with soluble organic iodine (SOI) species being the dominant fraction. Up to five organic anionic species were observed in the IC-ICP- MS chromatograms, although, other than iodoacetic acid, re- main unidentified. The most important consequence of the SOI in the aerosols is probably to increase the residence time of iodine within the particles (in particular by retarding io- dine release to the gas phase) thus possibly decreasing ozone destruction. Increased residence time may also facilitate io- dine transport out of the marine boundary layer into the free troposphere, and possibly even to the tropopause, by con- vective systems. This could explain the large iodine peak in aerosol spectra obtained by PALMS while sampling in the lower stratosphere (see Fig. 3 in Murphy et al., 2007). While it is most likely that organically bound iodine forms by aqueous phase chemistry in the aerosol, it would be use- ful for future laboratory studies to investigate the possibility of iodine-organic reactions in the gas phase and subsequent condensation as an alternative to the IO2-IO2 nucleation hy- pothesis.","['Murphy', 'Switzerland']"
Iron oxides in the cryoconite of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau abundance speciation and implications,"Abstract. Cryoconite is a mixture of impurities and ice visu- ally represented by dark colors present in the ablation zone of glaciers. As an important constituent of light-absorbing impurities on the glacier surface, iron oxides influence the radiative properties of mineral dust and thus its impact on ice melting processes. In particular, the distinct optical prop- erties between hematite and goethite (the major iron oxide species) highlight the necessity to obtain accurate knowledge about their abundance and geochemical behavior. Cryoconite samples from five glaciers in different regions of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and surroundings were studied. The iron abun- dance in the cryoconite from TP glaciers ranged from 3.40 % to 4.90 % by mass, in accordance with typical natural back- ground levels. Because the light absorption capacity of min- eral dust essentially depends on the presence of iron oxides (i.e., free iron), iron oxides were extracted and determined using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The ratios of free to total iron for the five glaciers ranged from 0.31 to 0.70, em- phasizing that iron in the form of oxides should be consid- ered rather than total iron in the albedo and radiative model- ing. Furthermore, the goethite content in iron oxides (in mass fraction) ranged from 81 % to 98 %, showing that goethite was the predominant form among the glaciers. Using the",,[]

Lagrangian modelling of dust admixture in gas flows,"Abstract. A method of calculating the dispersed-phase concentration in dusty gas flow, based on using the Lagrange form of the particle continuity equation, is developed. The method makes it possible to calculate the particle concentration along a fixed particle trajectory and to investigate flow regions with multiple intersection of particle trajectories and particle accumulation zones. The use of the method is illustrated by numerical calculations of the near-symmetry-axis region in a hypersonic flow colliding with a two-phase supersonic flow from a point source (the model of evaporation of a comet nucleus). It is demonstrated that, between the bow and termination shock waves, the particle concentration distribution may have a multi-layer structure with alternating layers of high and low particle concentration and sharp particle accumulation near the envelops of the particle trajectories.","The complete Lagrangian method proposed reduces the problem of calculating the particle concentration to a system of ordinary differential equations on a fixed particle trajectory and makes it possible to calculate the flow regions with mul- tiple intersection of particle trajectories and local zones of particle accumulation. In a hypersonic flow past a supersonic two-phase source, sharp stratification of dust concentration may occur between the bow and termination shock waves, with alternating layers of high and low particle concentration.",['Lagrange']
Lambertian reflectance and linear subspaces,"Ronen Basri??? David JacobsDept. of Computer Science NEC Research InstituteThe Weizmann Institute of Science 4 Independence WayRehovot, 76100 Israel Princeton, NJ 08540 AbstractWe prove that the set of all reectance functions (the mapping from surface normals to intensities)produced by Lambertian objects under distant, isotropic lighting lies close to a 9D linear subspace. Thisimplies that, in general, the set of images of a convex Lambertian object obtained under a wide varietyof lighting conditions can be approximated accurately by a low-dimensional linear subspace, explainingprior empirical results. We also provide a simple analytic characterization of this linear space. Weobtain these results by representing lighting using spherical harmonics and describing the e???ects ofLambertian materials as the analog of a convolution. These results allow us to construct algorithms forobject recognition based on linear methods as well as algorithms that use convex optimization to enforcenon-negative lighting functions. Finally, we show a simple way to enforce non-negative lighting whenthe images of an object lie near a 4D linear space.","method performs signi???cantly less well than the others, getting the correct answer about 60% of thetime. However, it is much faster, and seems to be quite e???ective under the simpler pose and lightingconditions. The 9D linear method and 9D positive lighting method each pick the correct model ???rst 86%of the time. With this data set, the di???erence between these two algorithms is quite small comparedto other sources of error. These may include limitations in our model for handling cast shadows andspecularities, but also includes errors in the model building and pose determination processes. In fact,on examining our results we found that one pose (for one person) was grossly wrong because a humanoperator selected feature points in the wrong order. We eliminated the six images (under six lightingconditions) that used this pose from our results.4 SpecularityIn general, it is a subject of future work to consider how this sort of analysis may be applied to morecomplex imaging situations that include specularities and cast shadows. However, in this section wewill make one basic remark about these situations.We note that a low-dimensional set of images can also result when the lighting itself is low-dimensional. This can occur when the lights are all di???use, as when the sun is behind clouds orlighting is due to inter-reections. In this case, the lighting itself may be well approximated by onlylow order harmonics. If the lighting is a linear combination of a small number of harmonics, thenimages will be a linear combination of those produced when the scene is rendered separately by eachof these harmonics. This low-dimensionality is due simply to the linearity of lighting, the fact that thesum of two images produced by any two lighting conditions will be the image produced by the sumof these lighting conditions. Therefore, this will be true under the most general imaging assumptions,including cast shadows and specularities.We also note that with specular objects, the bidirectional reection distribution function (BRDF)is generally much more sharply peaked than it is with the cosine function. This provides the intuitionthat specular objects will be more a???ected by high-order harmonic components of the lighting. In theextreme case of a mirror, the entire lighting function passes into the reectance function, preserving allcomponents of the lighting. Therefore, we expect that for specular objects, a low order approximationto the image set will be less accurate. A representation in terms of harmonic images may still providea useful approximation, however. This is consistent with the experiments of Epstein et al. [7].5 ConclusionsLighting can be arbitrarily complex. But in many cases its e???ect is not. When objects are Lambertian,we show that a simple, nine-dimensional linear subspace can capture the set of images they produce.This explains prior empirical results. It also gives us a new and e???ective way of understanding thee???ects of Lambertian reectance as that of a low-pass ???lter on lighting.20","['Lambertian', 'Israel']"
Land surface albedo derived on a daily basis from Meteosat Second Generation observations,"Abstract?€?Land surface albedo determines the repartition of downwelling solar radiation into components that are either re- flected back to the atmosphere or absorbed by the surface. As more sophisticated soil?€?vegetation?€?atmosphere transfer schemes are being implemented in numerical meteorological models, it will become increasingly important to accurately characterize the spatial and temporal albedo variations. Within the scope of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis, we have developed a daily albedo product, which is derived in near real time from observations provided by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument onboard the geostationary satellites of the Meteosat Second Generation series. The basic algorithm concept comprises an atmospheric correction scheme, the inversion of a linear semi- empirical model of the bidirectional reflectance distribution func- tion, the angular integration of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function to obtain spectral albedo, and the applica- tion of suitable conversion relations to derive broadband albedo estimates. The reflectance model inversion is performed each day based on the available set of clear-sky observations. In addition, constraints on the model parameters are taken into account in the inversion process. By specifying these constraints according to the previous model output in a recursive manner, a complete spatial coverage of the resulting albedo maps is achieved while, at the same time, preserving a high temporal resolution. This paper primarily concentrates on the description of the methodology. In addition, examples for the obtained albedo maps and time series, as well as the first validation results, are presented.",,[]
Large Asian dust layers continuously reached North America in April 2010,"Abstract. The NASA space-borne Mie-lidar system CALIPSO/CALIOP revealed that multiple large Asian dust layers with a horizontal scale of 2000?€?3000 km reached North America, occupying the full troposphere, in April 2010. This kind of dust layer transport has not been re- ported before. Our analysis of CALIOP data and global aerosol model results revealed that frequent dust emissions occurred in northwestern China because of stronger-than- average near-surface winds, and that strong stable westerly winds carried the Asian dust from northwestern China to the central Pacific Ocean. A negative pressure anomaly was lo- cated in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the main dust trans- port path was split into two branches: a northern path and a southern path over North America. Northern-path dust was trapped and stagnant for a longer time than southern path dust and finally subsided under a high-pressure system. Dust along the southern path reached the central US. These com- plex conditions resulted in a multi-layered structure of dust over North America.","Multiple large Asian dust plumes (2000?€?3000 km) arrived in North America in April 2010, occupying the full tropo- sphere. We conducted an analysis based on space-borne lidar measurements and a global dust transport model and produced seven main findings. (1) In 2010, stronger-than- average winds that may have been the result of a large neg- ative phase of the Arctic oscillation during the winter-spring of 2010 caused frequent large dust emissions in northwestern China (including the Taklimakan Desert). (2) A strong stable westerly moved from northwestern China to the central Pa- cific Ocean and frequently transported dust. (3) Dust trans- port height generally ranged from 2?€?10 km.

The negative pressure anomaly split the main dust transport into two branches: one (the northern path) over the western US-northern Canada?€?central/eastern US and the other (the southern path) over the western-central/southern-eastern US (5) Dust along the northern path became trapped within a high-pressure system and was stagnant for a longer time be- fore subsidence.

Largescale environmental controls on microbial biofilms in highalpine streams,"Abstract. Glaciers are highly responsive to global warming and important agents of landscape heterogeneity. While it is well established that glacial ablation and snowmelt regu- late stream discharge, linkage among streams and streamwa- ter geochemistry, the controls of these factors on stream mi- crobial biofilms remain insufficiently understood. We in- vestigated glacial (metakryal, hypokryal), groundwater-fed (krenal) and snow-fed (rhithral) streams ?€? all of them repre- sentative for alpine stream networks ?€? and present evidence that these hydrologic and hydrogeochemical factors differ- entially affect sediment microbial biofilms. Average micro- bial biomass and bacterial carbon production were low in the glacial streams, whereas bacterial cell size, biomass, and car- bon production were higher in the tributaries, most notably in the krenal stream. Whole-cell in situ fluorescence hybridiza- tion revealed reduced detection rates of the Eubacteria and higher abundance of ??-Proteobacteria in the glacial stream, a pattern that most probably reflects the trophic status of this ecosystem. Our data suggest low flow during the onset of snowmelt and autumn as a short period (hot moment) of fa- vorable environmental conditions with pulsed inputs of al- lochthonous nitrate and dissolved organic carbon, and with disproportionately high microbial growth. Tributaries are rel- atively more constant and favorable environments than kryal streams, and serve as possible sources of microbes and or- ganic matter to the main glacial channel during periods (e.g., snowmelt) of elevated hydrologic linkage among streams. Ice and snow dynamics ?€? and their impact on the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter ?€? have a crucial impact on stream biofilms, and we thus need to consider mi- crobes and critical hydrological episodes in future models of alpine stream communities.",,[]

Parallel to the tensile axis the model predictions are generally within the resolution of the diffraction measurements, but perpendicular to the tensile axis discrepancies are noted. Discrepancies between model and measurements were greater for the residual lattice strains than during loading.

Lightabsorbing impurities in Arctic snow,"Abstract. Absorption of radiation by ice is extremely weak at visible and near-ultraviolet wavelengths, so small amounts of light-absorbing impurities in snow can dominate the ab- sorption of solar radiation at these wavelengths, reducing the albedo relative to that of pure snow, contributing to the surface energy budget and leading to earlier snowmelt. In this study Arctic snow is surveyed for its content of light- absorbing impurities, expanding and updating the 1983?€? 1984 survey of Clarke and Noone. Samples were collected in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Svalbard, Norway, Russia, and the Arctic Ocean during 1998 and 2005?€?2009, on tun- dra, glaciers, ice caps, sea ice, frozen lakes, and in boreal forests. Snow was collected mostly in spring, when the en- tire winter snowpack is accessible for sampling. Sampling was carried out in summer on the Greenland Ice Sheet and on the Arctic Ocean, of melting glacier snow and sea ice as well as cold snow. About 1200 snow samples have been an- alyzed for this study.","The present survey has provided information about the ge- ographical and seasonal variations of BC and other LAA in Arctic snow, confirming that impurities in snow are signif- icant for the surface energy budget of the Arctic. Concen- trations are highest and most variable in the eastern Arctic (Scandinavia, Russia and Svalbard) and lower and less vari- able in the western Arctic (Canada and Alaska), with inter- mediate values for snow-covered sea ice and in bare sea ice on the Arctic Ocean. This is qualitatively consistent with GCM predictions (e.g. Fig. 5 of Flanner et al., 2007); a quan- titative comparison is needed and can now be done with the available data.","['Arctic Ocean', 'Arctic', 'Greenland', 'Arctic Ocean.', 'Russia']"

Mapping of snow water equivalent and snow depth in boreal and subarctic zones by assimilating spaceborne microwave radiometer data and groundbased ,Received 28 September 2005; received in revised form 7 December 2005; accepted 4 January 2006 Abstract,"The obtained results indicate that the assimilation of space- borne microwave radiometer data with operational ground- based snow observations improves the performance of SWE/SD estimation when compared with the case of interpolating discrete ground-based observations. This is the case when the assimilation technique applies a non-linear model to describe space-borne observations and adaptively takes into account the statistical accuracies of different data sources. Moreover, the results indicate that empirical algorithms or the inversion of brightness temperature modelling do not appear to provide sufficient SWE/SD retrieval accuracies without the use of supplementary reference data.",[]

Massloss rates and dusttogas ratios for obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch stars of different metallicities,"Abstract. The mass-loss rates and dust-to-gas ratios of obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are in- vestigated for samples with different initial metallicities: in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC & LMC) and in the Milky Way. The properties of their circumstel- lar envelopes can be explained in a consistent way if, both for obscured M-type AGB stars and for obscured carbon stars, the total (gas+dust) mass-loss rate M?? depends only weakly on initial metallicity whilst the dust-to-gas ratio ?? depends approximately linearly on initial metallicity.",,[]
MATLAB functions for Mie scattering and absorption version 2,"Abstract A set of MATLAB Functions for Mie calculations (M??tzler, 2002a) and for applica- tions to microwave radiation in rain (M??tzler, 2002b) has been improved and expanded by including magnetic and metal-like media and coated spheres. The appendix includes a discussion of the basic behaviour or the Riccati-Bessel and related Functions needed in the computations of Mie Coefficients. The applications of the Mie Functions are directed toward the study of radiative properties of precipitation. Functions have been developed to compute propagation parameters for freezing rain and melting graupel, assuming Marshall-Palmer drop- size distribution, including functions to compute the complex dielectric permittivi- ties of ice and water. Other applications can be envisaged if the dielectric or refrac- tive properties of the particles and their size distributions are known.","5 Conclusions This version of MATLAB Functions for Mie calculations expands on Version 1 (M??tzler, 2002a) by the wider range of parameters allowed in case of non-magnetic spheres, by the addition of functions for magnetic materials and for coated spheres. Furthermore, a deeper analysis of Riccati-Bessel Functions has taken place as a guide for situations in which numerical problems may occur. The applications of the present work have been concentrated on microwave and millimeter-wave radiation to precipitation in form of rain, freezing rain and melting graupel. As a simplification, it was assumed that the thickness of the coating is not dependent on the particle size. Interesting differences were found between the behaviour of ice spheres coated by liquid water and water spheres coated by ice. Based on the presented work, the applications can be extended to other particles. As an example, water-coated aerosols can be treated if the complex refractive index",[]
MAXDOAS measurements of atmospheric trace gases in Ny??lesundRadiative transfer studies and their application,"Abstract. A new approach to derive tropospheric concen- trations of some atmospheric trace gases from ground-based UV/vis measurements is described. The instrument, referred to as the MAX-DOAS, is based on the well-known UV/vis instruments, which use the sunlight scattered in the zenith sky as the light source and the method of Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) to derive column amounts of absorbers like ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Substantial en- hancements have been applied to this standard setup to use different lines of sight near to the horizon as additional light sources (MAX ?€? multi axis). Results from measurements at Ny-A??lesund (79??? N, 12??? E) are presented and interpreted with the full-spherical radiative transfer model SCIATRAN. In particular, measurements of the oxygen dimer O4 which has a known column and vertical distribution in the atmo- sphere are used to evaluate the sensitivity of the retrieval to parameters such as multiple scattering, solar azimuth, surface albedo and refraction in the atmosphere and also to validate the radiative transfer model. As a first application, measure- ments of NO2 emissions from a ship lying in Ny-A??lesund harbour are presented. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of long term UV/vis multi axis measurement that can be used to derive not only column amounts of dif- ferent trace gases but also some information on the vertical location of these absorbers.","A novel multi-axis UV/visible instrument (MAX-DOAS) has been described, that measures not only in the zenith direc- tion, but also at several lines of sight close to the horizon. The instrument is operating in Ny-A??lesund in a 2 direction viewing mode since 1999 and with 5 viewing directions since March 2002.",[]

Measurement of solid precipitation with an optical disdrometer,"Abstract. A study about measurements of solid precipita- tion using an optical disdrometer is presented. The optical disdrometer is an improved version of the ODM 470 dis- drometer. It allows to measure hydrometeors within a size range of 0.4 to 22 mm in diameter. The main advantage of this instrument is its ability to esti- mate accurately precipitation even under strong wind condi- tions (Gro??klaus, 1996). To measure solid precipitation a ge- ometrical model was developed to determine the mean cross- sectional area of snow crystals for different predefined shapes and sizes. It serves to develop an algorithm, which relates the mean cross sectional area of snow crystals to their max- imum dimension, liquid water content, and terminal veloc- ity. The algorithm was applied to disdrometer measurements during winter 1999/2000 in Uppsala/Sweden. Resulting pre- cipitation was compared to independent measurements of a Geonor gauge and to manual measurements. In terms of daily precipitation the disdrometer shows a reliable perfor- mance.",The present sensitivity study concerning the transforma- tion between the maximum dimension and the mean cross- sectional area of snow crystals is based on a theoretical ex- periment considering six exemplary snow crystal types. Un- der these preconditions it is shown that only one parameteri- sation of terminal fall velocity and liquid water content is re- quired to calculate the precipitation rate from measurements of the optical disdrometer ODM 470. In a first attempt the algorithm was applied to solid precipita- tion measurements from winter 1999/2000 in Uppsala. The results indicate a general overestimation of precipitation rates from disdrometer measurements compared to other methods.

Measurement of the specific surface area of snow using infrared reflectance in an integrating sphere at 1310 and 1550 nm,"Abstract. Even though the specific surface area (SSA) and the snow area index (SAI) of snow are crucial variables to determine the chemical and climatic impact of the snow cover, few data are available on the subject. We propose here a novel method to measure snow SSA and SAI. It is based on the measurement of the hemispherical infrared re- flectance of snow samples using the DUFISSS instrument (DUal Frequency Integrating Sphere for Snow SSA measure- ment). DUFISSS uses the 1310 or 1550 nm radiation of laser diodes, an integrating sphere 15 cm in diameter, and InGaAs photodiodes. For SSA<60 m2 kg???1, we use the 1310 nm ra- diation, reflectance is between 15 and 50% and the accuracy of SSA determination is 10%. For SSA>60 m2 kg???1, snow is usually of low density (typically 30 to 100 kg m???3), resulting in insufficient optical depth and 1310 nm radiation reaches the bottom of the sample, causing artifacts. The 1550 nm ra- diation is therefore used for SSA>60 m2 kg???1. Reflectance is then in the range 5 to 12% and the accuracy on SSA is 12%. We propose empirical equations to determine SSA from re- flectance at both wavelengths, with that for 1310 nm taking into account the snow density. DUFISSS has been used to measure the SSA of snow and the SAI of snowpacks in polar and Alpine regions.","DUFISSS allows the rapid determination of snow SSA in the field with an accuracy better than 12%. The principle, tech- nology and use of DUFISSS are simple, making it a useful tool for chemical, climate, and snow physics research. As stated in the introduction, it can be used to study atmosphere- snow exchanges of chemicals (Burniston et al., 2007), es- pecially right after snow falls, when SSA decreases rapidly. Hopefully it can also be used to help relate changes in snow radiative properties to snow physical properties, in particular in remote sensing studies. This may not be simple, however, because radiative properties measured in the field or derived from satellites are usually directional, not hemispherical, and complex BRDF considerations may be necessary. New ap- proaches however appear promising (Zege et al., 2008). Fi- nally, this rapid method will be beneficial for the study of snow physics, and in particular the understanding of the fac- tors affecting the rate of SSA changes, because in the past this has been limited by the small amount of data that could be obtained by CH4 adsorption (Taillandier et al., 2007).",[]

Measurements of lightabsorbing impurities in snow over four glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau,"Black carbon (BC), dust, and organic carbon (OC) aerosols, when deposited onto the surface of glaciers, can absorb light and decrease the snow albedo. These impurities in snow are referred to as ILAIs (i.e., insoluble light absorbing impurities). Atmospheric chemical models have been extensively used to simulate the transport and deposition of atmospheric aerosols in glacierized areas. However, systematic investigations of ILAIs in snowpack of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are rare. In this study, observations of ILAIs in snow and simulations of ILAIs of atmospheric aerosol at surface over four glaciers on the TP have been analyzed. Strong correlation between BC and dust was found in surface aged-snow, and their correlation significantly varied with snowpit depth. BC and OC concentrations in snowpit tended to decrease with depth. Significant differences of ILAI concentrations among depth intervals reflect their diverse hydrophilicities, physiochemical properties and post- depositional processes in snowpit, offering important observational constraints on the related processes. Monthly variation of atmospheric ILAIs at surface over glaciers is characterized by distinct spatial heterogeneity. The statistical results show higher ILAI concentrations in the summer of 2015 than 2014, which is in qualitative agreement with CALIPSO observations, likely reflecting the effects of inter-annual variation of summer monsoon on snow ILAI loadings. Optical attenuation (ATN) of BC is gradually decreased with depth of snowpit, whereas the trend of mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of BC throughout the profile of snowpit is opposite to that of ATN. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging demonstrates that calcium and silicon rich particles dominate over biological, quartz and flying ash particles in the cryoconite, providing additional constraints on the sources of dust-in-snow and can facilitate better understanding of the physicochemical properties and cli- matic effects of particles in the glacial cryoconite.","	Conclusions 	Data availability 	Declarations of Competing Interest 	Author contributions 	Acknowledgments 	mk:H1_19 	mk:H1_20 	Supplementary data 	References",['Tibetan Plateau']

Melting trends over the Greenland ice sheet 19582009 from spaceborne microwave data and regional climate models,"Abstract. To study near-surface melt changes over the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) since 1979, melt extent estimates from two regional climate models were compared with those obtained from spaceborne microwave brightness tempera- tures using two different remote sensing algorithms. The results from the two models were consistent with those ob- tained with the remote sensing algorithms at both daily and yearly time scales, encouraging the use of the models for an- alyzing melting trends before the satellite era (1958?€?1979), when forcing data is available. Differences between satellite- derived and model-simulated results still occur and are used here to identify (i) biases in the snow models (notably in the albedo parametrization, in the thickness of a snow layer, in the maximum liquid water content within the snowpack and in the snowfall impacting the bare ice appearance in summer) and (ii) limitations in the use of passive microwave data for snowmelt detection at the edge of the ice sheet due to mixed pixel effect (e.g., tundra or rock nearby the ice sheet). The results from models and spaceborne microwave sensors con- firm a significant (p-value = 0.01) increase in GrIS surface melting since 1979. The melt extent recorded over the last years (1998, 2003, 2005 and 2007) is unprecedented in the last 50 yr with the cumulated melt area in the 2000?€?s being, on the average, twice that of the 1980?€?s.",,['Greenland']

Meteorology and hydrology in Yosemite National Park A sensor network application,"Abstract. Over half of California?€?s water supply comes from high elevations in the snowmelt-dominated Sierra Nevada. Natural climate fluctuations, global warming, and the growing needs of water consumers demand intelligent management of this water resource. This requires a comprehensive monitoring system across and within the Sierra Nevada. Unfortunately, because of severe terrain and limited access, few measurements exist. Thus, meteorological and hydrologic processes are not well understood at high altitudes. However, new sensor and wireless communication technologies are beginning to provide sensor packages designed for low maintenance operation, low power con- sumption and unobtrusive footprints. A prototype network of meteorological and hydrological sensors has been deployed in Yosemite National Park, traversing elevation zones from 1,200 to 3,700 m. Communication techniques must be tailored to suit each location, resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions. Results are showing how, in some years, snowmelt may occur quite uniformly over the Sierra, while in others it varies with elevation.",,"['National Park', 'Yosemite National Park', 'Sierra Nevada.']"

Microbeclay interactions as a mechanism for the preservation of organic matter and trace metal biosignatures in black shales,"Organic-rich, fine-grained sedimentary rocks, such as black shales, are important geochemical archives providing information on the evolution of seawater composition and biological activity over the past 3 billion years. While biological productivity and sedimentation rates greatly affect the organic matter content in these rocks, mechanisms linking these two processes remain poorly resolved. Here, we examine the interactions of clay minerals with the marine planktonic cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. We suggest that clays settling through the water column could influence carbon and trace metal burial in three ways: (1) the interaction of reactive clay surfaces with the bacterial cells increases organic matter deposition via mass increase in a seawater growth medium by several orders of magnitude; (2) reactive bacterial cells become completely encased within a clay shroud, enhancing the preservation potential of this organic matter; and (3) the trace metal content of the biomass buried along with metals sorbed to the clay particles contributes to the trace metal concentrations of the black shale precursor sediments. Significantly, our findings imply that the chemical composition of ancient, organic-rich, fine-grained deposits are not only archives of ancient seawater composition and redox state, but they also provide a record of the degree of biological activity in the water column through geological time.","This study had a number of aims, one of which was to investigate the role that clay minerals have in flocculating microbial cells from suspension. The addition of montmorillonite or kaolinite (in 5 g/L or 50 g/L concentrations) to a suspension of Synechococcus cells was found to dramatically increase settling rates of both cells and clay; cells were brought out of suspension within 15 min. In contrast, live Synechococcus cells were found to increase in concentration when no clay was added. Cell metabolism was not found to be a factor as both live and dead cell populations behaved in a similar manner in the presence of clay. These findings agree with previous work which reported the ability of clay to sediment microbial cells from suspension (e.g. Beaulieu et al., 2005). As cyanobacteria have been recognized as major contributors to the organic matter content of some organic-rich marine shale deposits (Ohkouchi et al., 2006), this depositional mechanism could account for the deposition of these organic-rich shale deposits. This would suggest an environment of deposition where large microbial populations, such as cyanobacterial blooms, could occur in addition to regular clay input, such as an estuary or other coastal regions, where events such as monsoons could transport large amounts of clay to the basin. In addition, kaolinite is known to be preferentially deposited close to shore and is associated with increased continental weathering (Thiry, 2000). The increased nutrient delivery is conducive to microorganisms (e.g. cyanobacterial blooms), and, in association with the kaolinite from continental weathering, would promote the formation of organic-rich deposits. This supports deltaic, estuarine, or related depositional setting for the formation of these organic-rich deposits. Kaolinite is also stable over long periods of time (compared to other clays, such as smectite; Thiry, 2000), suggesting that long-term cyanobacterial encasement is feasible.",[]

Microwave emission model for wet snow by using radiative transfer and strong fluctuation theory,"Abstract?€?This study is concerned with the development of a model to describe microwave emission from terrain covered by wet snow. The model is based on the radiative transfer theory and the strong fluctu- ation theory. Wet snow is treated in the model as a mixture of dry snow and water inclusions. The shape of the water inclusions is taken into account. The effective permittivity is calculated by using the two-phase strong fluctuation theory model with nonsymmetrical inclu- sions. The phase matrix and the extinction coefficient of wet snow for an anisotropic correlation function with azimuth symmetric are used. The vector radiative transfer equation for a layer of a random medium was solved by using Gaussian quadrature and eigen analy- sis. The model behaviour is illustrated by using typical parameters encountered in microwave remote sensing of wet snow. Comparisons with emissivity data at 11, 21 and 35 GHz are made. It is shown that the model predictions fit the experimental data.",,[]
Mineral dust is a sink for chlorine in the marine boundary layer,Received 18 November 2006; received in revised form 16 April 2007; accepted 22 May 2007 Abstract,"We demonstrate the uptake of chlorine by mineral dust particles in the marine boundary layer due to heterogeneous reactions involving HCl(g). On-line single-particle analysis allows the exclusion of chloride contributions to dust caused by internal mixtures of dust and sea-salt particles. We hypothe- size that the release of HCl(g) from acidified sea-salt particles, caused by reaction with H2SO4 after uptake of volcanic SO2(g), resulted in elevated concentrations of HCl(g) available for reaction with dust particles. This uptake of SO2(g) and NOy(g) by sea-salt prior to the dust front?€?s arrival reduced the availability of sulfate and nitrate precursors, thus allowing the elevated HCl(g) to react unimpeded with the alkaline mineral dust. Simulations of aerosol chemistry from the STEM-2K3 model support this hypothesis and agree with our observa- tions of substantial chlorine uptake by mineral dust during the dust front. This chemical process has important implications for the budgets of ClOx, NOx, SOx, and O3 in the marine boundary layer, the atmospheric processing and lifetime of dust, and the long-range transport of chlorine. The enrichment of chloride in mineral dust can invalidate estimates of sea-salt aerosol concentrations and aging derived from filter measurements. Uptake of chlorine by dust can also alter the direct and indirect climate forcings of mineral dust particles and their role as nutrient vectors to remote ocean regions. Global chemical models must therefore include this reac- tion to produce a more accurate description of atmospheric chemistry and climate.",[]

Modeling active microwave remote sensing of snow using dense media radiative transfer DMRT theory with multiplescattering effects,"Abstract?€?Dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) theory is used to study the multiple-scattering effects in active microwave remote sensing. Simplified DMRT phase matrices are obtained in the 1?€?2 frame. The simplified expressions facilitate solutions of the DMRT equations and comparisons with other phase matrices. First-order, second-order, and full multiple-scattering solutions of the DMRT equations are obtained. To solve the DMRT equa- tion, we decompose the diffuse intensities into Fourier series in the azimuthal direction. Each harmonic is solved by the eigen- quadrature approach. The model is applied to the active microwave remote sensing of terrestrial snow. Full multiple- scattering effects are important as the optical thickness for snow at frequencies above 10 GHz often exceed unity. The results are illus- trated as a function of frequency, incidence angle, and snow depth. The results show that cross polarization for the case of densely packed spheres can be significant and can be merely 6 to 8 dB below copolarization. The magnitudes of the cross polarization are consistent with the experimental observations. The results show that the active 13.5-GHz backscattering coefficients still have significant sensitivity to snow thickness even for snow thickness exceeding 1 m.",,[]
Modeling chemistry in and above snow at Summit GreenlandPart 1 Model description and results,"Abstract. Sun-lit snow is increasingly recognized as a chem- ical reactor that plays an active role in uptake, transforma- tion, and release of atmospheric trace gases. Snow is known to influence boundary layer air on a local scale, and given the large global surface coverage of snow may also be signifi- cant on regional and global scales. We present a new detailed one-dimensional snow chemistry module that has been cou- pled to the 1-D atmospheric boundary layer model MISTRA. The new 1-D snow module, which is dynamically coupled to the overlaying atmospheric model, includes heat transport in the snowpack, molecular diffusion, and wind pumping of gases in the interstitial air. The model includes gas phase chemical reactions both in the interstitial air and the atmo- sphere. Heterogeneous and multiphase chemistry on atmo- spheric aerosol is considered explicitly. The chemical inter- action of interstitial air with snow grains is simulated assum- ing chemistry in a liquid-like layer (LLL) on the grain sur- face.

Modeling organic aerosols during MILAGRO importance of biogenic secondary organic aerosols,"Abstract. The meso-scale chemistry-transport model CHIMERE is used to assess our understanding of major sources and formation processes leading to a fairly large amount of organic aerosols ?€? OA, including primary OA (POA) and secondary OA (SOA) ?€? observed in Mexico City during the MILAGRO field project (March 2006). Chemical analyses of submicron aerosols from aerosol mass spectrom- eters (AMS) indicate that organic particles found in the Mex- ico City basin contain a large fraction of oxygenated organic species (OOA) which have strong correspondence with SOA, and that their production actively continues downwind of the city. The SOA formation is modeled here by the one-step ox- idation of anthropogenic (i.e. aromatics, alkanes), biogenic (i.e. monoterpenes and isoprene), and biomass-burning SOA precursors and their partitioning into both organic and aque- ous phases. Conservative assumptions are made for uncer- tain parameters to maximize the amount of SOA produced by the model. The near-surface model evaluation shows that predicted OA correlates reasonably well with measurements during the campaign, however it remains a factor of 2 lower than the measured total OA. Fairly good agreement is found between predicted and observed POA within the city sug- gesting that anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are reasonably captured. Consistent with previous studies in","This article uses an air quality model to investigate the pro- cesses controlling organic aerosols, with a particular focus on SOA formation, in the vicinity of Mexico City.

Modeling the observed microwave emission from shallow multilayer tundra snow using DMRTML,"Abstract: The observed brightness temperatures (Tb) at 37 GHz from typical moderate density dry snow in mid-latitudes decreases with increasing snow water equivalent (SWE) due to volume scattering of the ground emissions by the overlying snow. At a certain point, however, as SWE increases, the emission from the snowpack offsets the scattering of the sub-nivean emission. In tundra snow, the Tb slope reversal occurs at shallower snow thicknesses. While it has been postulated that the inflection point in the seasonal time series of observed Tb V 37 GHz of tundra snow is controlled by the formation of a thick wind slab layer, the simulation of this effect has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, the Dense Media Radiative Transfer Theory for Multi Layered (DMRT-ML) snowpack is used to predict the passive microwave response from airborne observations over shallow, dense, slab-layered tundra snow. Airborne radiometer observations coordinated with ground-based in situ snow measurements were acquired in the Canadian high Arctic near Eureka, NT, in April 2011. The DMRT-ML was parameterized with the in situ snow measurements using a two-layer snowpack and run in two configurations: a depth hoar and a wind slab dominated pack. With these two configurations, the calibrated DMRT-ML successfully predicted the Tb V 37 GHz response (R correlation of 0.83) when compared with the observed airborne Tb footprints containing snow pits measurements. Using this calibrated model, the DMRT-ML was applied to the whole study region. At the satellite observation scale, observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) over the study area reflected seasonal differences between Tb V 37 GHz and Tb V 19 GHz that supports the hypothesis of the development of an early season volume scattering depth hoar layer, followed by the growth of the late season emission-dominated wind slab layer. This research highlights the necessity to consider the two-part emission characteristics of a slab-dominated tundra snowpack at 37 GHz Tb.","The obtained 21 cm threshold in the Tb-snow depth inflection is lower but comparable to other findings elsewhere. For example, Sturm et al. [44] observed a 110 mm SWE (31 cm snow depth) threshold using ground-based observations. Rosenfeld and Grody [14] showed threshold minima of 20 cm and 45 cm using spaceborne observations in different case studies while explaining this phenomenon as an anomalous signature and modeling it using a two-stream Dense Media Theory. However, no comprehensive in situ snow pit data with snow structural information were available to conclusively support these findings. In the study by Derksen et al. [11], a threshold of 130 mm of SWE was observed but neither averaged density nor equivalent snow depth were reported at the airborne observation scale (70 m ?? 120 m). The range of differences is likely attributed to the differences between the sampling of high spatially variable snow properties at different scales: point ground measurements [10,15] and area airborne measurements [11]. The presence of dominant wind slab layers with high snow densities in our study area likely resulted in a lower threshold for the observed 37 GHz Tb V inflection point, explaining why the inflection point of 68 mm of SWE (21 cm snow depth) was lower than those values reported in previous studies. The measured airborne Tbs and the DMRT-ML simulated slope reversal of Tb at 37 GHz, documented in this study suggests that this threshold, and the modeling approach taken, is generalizable to other Arctic tundra snow environments.",[]

Modelling and measuring the spectral bidirectional reflectance factor of snowcovered sea ice an intercomparison study,"Broadband albedo is a very important geophysical parameter in the Earth surface?€?atmosphere interaction in either global climate change or hydrological cycle and snowmelt runoff studies. To derive the broadband albedo accurately from satellite optical sensor observation at limited bands and at a single observation angle, the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) has to be specified quantitatively. In the present albedo derivation algorithms from the satellite radiance data, the BRF is either modelled or observed. Questions may arise as to how well a BRF model can be in the broadband albedo derivation. To help answer such questions, we studied the performance of a snow-surface BRF model for two specific cases under large solar zenith angles (65?? and 85??). We measured snow-surface spectral directional reflectance under clear skies. The snow physical properties, such as snow grain size and snow density, at the same sites were also measured. In situ snow physical data are used to simulate the snow-surface BRF and hemispherical directional reflectance factor (HDRF) through a multilayered azimuth- and zenith-dependent plane-parallel radiative transfer model. The field measurements and BRF and HDRF simulations all reveal the forward-scattering nature of snow surface under large solar incidence angles, but the BRF model results depict the strongest forward-scattering patterns under such solar zenith angles. Because the HDRF is simulated through coupling of the surface BRF with radiative transfer in the atmosphere, the resulting HDRF patterns agree with the field measurements better than the simulated BRF does. The deviation of the simulated HDRF from field-based clear-sky directional reflectance (FCDR) is within ??10% for the central (viewing zenith angle <45??) and lateral sides of the viewing hemisphere. This level of agreement between the simulated HDRF and FCDR also implies that the simulated BRF model can provide remote-sensing estimates of spectral albedo with an uncertainty of ??10% for the same part of the viewing hemisphere. Further improvement in BRF model performance requires better handling of single scattering properties of snow grains, surface roughness, and atmospheric correction. Also, better procedures and techniques in field measurement are necessary for more accurate assessment of the performance of BRF models. Copyright ??? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,['Earth']
Modelling hydrologic impacts of light absorbing aerosol deposition on snow at the catchment scale,"Abstract. Light absorbing impurities in snow and ice (LAISI) originating from atmospheric deposition enhance snowmelt by increasing the absorption of shortwave radia- tion. The consequences are a shortening of the snow dura- tion due to increased snowmelt and, at the catchment scale, a temporal shift in the discharge generation during the spring melt season.","Herein we presented a newly developed snow algorithm for application in hydrologic models that allows a new class of model input variable: the deposition rates of light absorbing aerosols. By coupling a radiative transfer model for snow to an energy-balance-based snowpack model, we are provid- ing a tool that can be used to determine the effect of vari- ous species of LAISI at the catchment scale. In this analysis we have focused solely on BC and acknowledge it therefore likely represents a conservative estimate. This work presents a novel analysis of the impact of BC deposition to snow on the hydrologic cycle through 1-D sensitivity studies and catchment-scale hydrologic modelling. From a 1-D model study, presented in Sect. 5.1, we conclude that",[]
Modelling soil dust aerosol in the Bod??l?? depression during the BoDEx campaign,"Abstract. We present regional model simulations of the dust emission events during the Bode??le?? Dust Experiment (BoDEx) that was carried out in February and March 2005 in Chad. A box model version of the dust emission model is used to test different input parameters for the emission model, and to compare the dust emissions computed with observed wind speeds to those calculated with wind speeds from the regional model simulation. While field observa- tions indicate that dust production occurs via self-abrasion of saltating diatomite flakes in the Bode??le??, the emission model based on the assumption of dust production by saltation and using observed surface wind speeds as input parameters re- produces observed dust optical thicknesses well. Although the peak wind speeds in the regional model underestimate the highest wind speeds occurring on 10?€?12 March 2005, the spatio-temporal evolution of the dust cloud can be reasonably well reproduced by this model. Dust aerosol interacts with solar and thermal radiation in the regional model; it is re- sponsible for a decrease in maximum daytime temperatures by about 5 K at the beginning the dust storm on 10 March 2005. This direct radiative effect of dust aerosol accounts for about half of the measured temperature decrease compared to conditions on 8 March. Results from a global dust model suggest that the dust from the Bode??le?? is an important contrib- utor to dust crossing the African Savannah region towards the Gulf of Guinea and the equatorial Atlantic, where it can con- tribute up to 40% to the dust optical thickness.",,"['Savannah', 'Gulf of Guinea', 'of Guinea']"
Modelling the influence of snow accumulation and snowice formation on the seasonal cycle of the Antarctic seaice cover,"Abstract Recent observational and numerical studies of the maritime snow cover in the Antarctic suggest that snow on top of sea ice plays a major role in shaping the seasonal growth and decay of the ice pack in the Southern Ocean. Here, we make a quantitative assessment of the importance of snow accumulation in controlling the seasonal cycle of the ice cover with a coupled snow?€?sea-ice?€?upper-ocean model. The model takes into account snow and ice sublimation and snow deposition by condensation. A parametrisation of the formation of snow ice (ice resulting from the freezing of a mixture of snow and seawater produced by flooding of the ice floes) is also included. Experiments on the sensitivity of the snow?€?sea-ice system to vari- ations in the sublimation/condensation rate, the pre- cipitation rate, and the amount of snowfall transported by the wind into leads are discussed. Although we focus on the model response in the Southern Hemisphere, results for the Arctic are also discussed in some cases to highlight the relative importance of the processes under study in both hemispheres. It is found that the snow loss by sublimation can account for the removal of 0.45 m of snow per year in the Antarctic and that this loss significantly affects the total volume of snow ice. A precipitation decrease of 50% is conducive to large reductions in the Antarctic snow and snow-ice volumes, but it leads only to an 8% decrease in the annual mean ice volume. The Southern Ocean ice pack is more sensi- tive to increases in precipitation. For precipitation rates 1.5 times larger than the control ones, the annual mean",,"['volume.

Monitoring of snow surface nearinfrared bidirectional reflectance factors with added lightabsorbing particles,"Abstract. Broadband snow albedo can range from 0.3 to 0.9 depending on microphysical properties and light-absorbing particle (LAP) concentrations. Beyond the widely observed direct and visibly apparent effect of darkening snow, it is still unclear how LAPs influence snow albedo feedbacks. To in- vestigate LAPs?€? indirect effect on snow albedo feedbacks, we developed and calibrated the Near-Infrared Emitting and Reflectance-Monitoring Dome (NERD) and monitored bidi- rectional reflectance factors (BRFs) hourly after depositing dust and black carbon (BC) particles onto experimental snow surfaces. After comparing snow infrared BRFs to snow spe- cific surface areas (SSAs), we found that both measured and modeled snow infrared BRFs are correlated with snow SSA. These results, however, demonstrate a considerable uncer- tainty of ?? 10 m2 kg???1 in the determination of snow SSA from our BRF measurements. The nondestructive technique for snow SSA retrieval that we present here can be further developed for science applications that require rapid in situ snow SSA measurements. After adding large amounts of dust and BC to snow, we found more rapid decreasing of snow BRFs and SSAs in snow with added LAPs compared to nat- ural (clean) snow but only during clear-sky conditions. These results suggest that deposition of LAPs onto snow can accel- erate snow metamorphism via a net positive snow grain-size feedback.","LAPs in snow accelerated snow metamorphism and en- hanced positive grain-size feedback during cloud free, calm weather conditions when surface air temperatures were near 0 ???C. To observe this effect, we engineered an instrument (i.e., the NERD) that measures 1.30 and 1.55 ??m snow BRFs without destroying snow samples.

Multiplescale modelling of forest snow sublimation initial findings,"Abstract: Physically based equations describing snow interception and sublimation processes were applied to canopy- intercepted snow using a fractal scaling technique to provide a snow-covered forest boundary condition for a one- dimensional land surface scheme. Modi??cation of the land surface scheme's calculation of turbulent transfer and within-canopy ambient humidity was required to accommodate this nested control volume approach. Tests in late winter in a southern boreal forest mature jack pine stand against measured sublimation found that the coupled model provides good approximations of sublimation losses on half-hourly and event bases. Daily sublimation averaged 0???5 kg m??2 daily, with minimum and maximum daily losses of 0???16 and 0???72 kg m??2. Cumulative errors in estimating canopy temperature, humidity and intercepted snow load over 7 days of simulation were ?? 0???7 K, ?? 4???15% of the average observed vapour pressure, and 0???103 kg m??2, respectively. At a nearby regenerating jack pine site, measured peak latent heat ranged from ?? 14???6 W m??2 to -40???9 W m??2. Testing of the model at this site yielded reasonable estimates of latent and sensible heat ??uxes during an overnight event, but did not estimate latent heat ??ux as well during events involving larger snow loads and incoming solar radiation, possibly as a result of errors introduced by solving for within-canopy humidity and neglect of subcanopy snow energetics. Further work to improve heat storage terms, and the inclusion of subcanopy snow energetics could help improve the coupled model performance. Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,[]

Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing of alpine snow properties,"??? Abstract Models of processes in the alpine snow cover fundamentally depend on the spatial distribution of the surface energy balance over areas where topographic variability causes huge differences in the incoming solar radiation and in snow depth because of redistribution by wind. At a spatial scale commensurate with that of the terrain, we want to know which areas are covered by snow, and we want to estimate the snow?€?s spectral albedo, along with other properties such as grain size, contaminants, temperature, liquid water content, and depth or water equivalent. From multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing at wavelengths from 0.4?€?15 ??m, the retrievable properties include snow-covered area, albedo, grain size, liquid water very near the surface, and temperature. Spectral mixture analysis allows the retrieval of the subpixel variability of snow-covered area, along with the snow?€?s albedo. Remaining research challenges include the remote sensing of absorbing impurities; accounting for variabil- ity in the bidirectional-reflectance distribution function and the variability of grain size with depth; retrieving snow cover in forested regions; reconciling field measurements of emissivity with snow properties; and adapting the algorithms to frequent, large-scale processing.",,[]
MultiStaged NDVI Dependent SnowFree LandSurface Shortwave Albedo NarrowbandtoBroadband NTB Coefficients and Their Sensitivity Analysis,"Abstract: Narrowband-to-broadband conversion is a critical procedure for mapping land-surface broadband albedo using multi-spectral narrowband remote-sensing observations. Due to the significant difference in optical characteristics between soil and vegetation, NTB conversion is influenced by the variation in vegetation coverage on different surface types. To reduce this influence, this paper applies an approach that couples NTB coefficient with the NDVI. Multi-staged NDVI dependent NTB coefficient look-up tables (LUT) for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Polarization and Directionality of Earth?€?s Reflectance (POLDER) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were calculated using 6000 spectra samples collected from two typical spectral databases. Sensitivity analysis shows that NTB conversion is affected more by the NDVI for sensors with fewer band numbers, such as POLDER and AVHRR. Analysis of the validation results based on simulations, in situ measurements and global albedo products indicates that by using the multi-staged NDVI dependent NTB method, the conversion accuracies of these two sensors could be improved by 2%?€?13% on different NDVI classes compared with the general method. This improvement could be as high as 15%, on average, and 35% on dense vegetative surface compared with the global broadband albedo product of POLDER. This paper shows that it is necessary to consider surface reflectance characteristics associated with the NDVI on albedo-NTB conversion for remote sensors with fewer than five bands.","In this paper, using multiple linear regression of simulated narrowband and broadband albedos under various NDVI stratified surface types, multi-staged NDVI dependent NTB coefficient LUTs were developed for three sensors with different band numbers: MODIS, POLDER and AVHRR. The conversion accuracy of the multi-staged NDVI dependent NTB method was validated by evaluating the agreements between the converted surface broadband albedos using simulations and in situ measurements. This validation was also implemented for the conversion coefficients of general methods. Comparative analyses of the validation results of multi-staged NDVI dependent and general NTB methods revealed that the NDVI is sensitive to land-surface albedo NTB conversion, especially for sensors with fewer bands, such as POLDER and AVHRR. The conversion accuracies of these two sensors were effectively improved using the new method proposed in this paper that couples the NTB coefficients with the NDVI.",[]

New considerations about the fracture mode of PZT ceramics,,"In this work, the role of the microstructure of PZT ceramics has been highlighted in the fracture mode. Indeed, hard PZT present better fracture properties and major intragranular mode of fracture. On the opposite, cracks propagate mainly through the grain boundaries in soft PZT. The observation and quantification of the intergranular micro porosity proves that it is responsible for these aspects of fracture behaviour. The fracture toughness is also higher for hard PZT than for soft ones. The size and morphology of the domains are different for the two types of PZT. The lath-like form indicates a possible boundary segregation of the soft additives, changing the grain boundary energy and weakening the grain boundaries in the soft PZT ceramics. An interesting extension of this work is the local study of chemical composition by means of STEM analysis. These measurements would also allow the determination of chemical heterogeneities.",[]

Numerical modeling of permafrost dynamics in Alaska using a high spatial resolution dataset,"Abstract. Climate projections for the 21st century indicate that there could be a pronounced warming and permafrost degradation in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Climate warming is likely to cause permafrost thawing with sub- sequent effects on surface albedo, hydrology, soil organic matter storage and greenhouse gas emissions.","The increase in mean annual air temperatures and the amount of precipitation for the northern part of the region predicted by the five GCM composite with A1B emission scenario could accelerate permafrost warming in the North (Fig. 13). The central part of the region, depending on the correspond- ing ecosystem, would experience permafrost degradation at different severity levels. The effect of the upper organic layer, soil water saturation and soil thermal properties play a sig- nificant role, providing necessary resilience for permafrost to sustain, even when MAAT are close or slightly above 0 ???C. To provide an estimate of the permafrost degradation severity level for a specific geographic location, the effects of varying climatic and ecological conditions require more detailed investigation.","['Alaska', 'Arctic']"

Observed highaltitude warming and snow cover retreat over Tibet and the Himalayas enhanced by black carbon aerosols,"Himalayan mountain glaciers and the snowpack over the Tibetan Plateau provide the headwater of several major rivers in Asia. In-situ observations of snow cover frac- tion since the 1960s suggest that the snow pack in the region have retreated signif- icantly, accompanied by a surface warming of 2?€?2.5 ???C observed over the peak alti-5 tudes (5000 m). Using a high-resolution ocean?€?atmosphere global climate model and an observationally constrained black carbon (BC) aerosol forcing, we attribute the ob- served altitude dependence of the warming trends as well as the spatial pattern of reductions in snow depths and snow cover fraction to various anthropogenic factors. At the Tibetan Plateau altitudes, the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration exerted10 a warming of 1.7 ???C, BC 1.3 ???C where as cooling aerosols cause about 0.7 ???C cooling, bringing the net simulated warming consistent with the anomalously large observed warming. We therefore conclude that BC together with CO2 has contributed to the snow retreat trends. Especially, BC increase is the major factor in the strong elevation dependence of the observed surface warming. The atmospheric warming by BC as well15 as its surface darkening of snow are coupled with the positive snow albedo feedbacks to account for the disproportionately large role of BC in high-elevation regions. These findings reveal that BC impact needs to be properly accounted for in future regional climate projections, in particular on high-altitude cryosphere.","The observed surface warming over the Tibetan and Himalayan region of about 0.5 ???C15 at sea level to about 2?€?2.5 ???C at 5000 m (from 1961 to 2006) has been an outstanding feature of climate trends. The more than 2 ???C warming is close to the peak warming trend observed anywhere on the planet. For comparison, the Arctic warming associated with large sea-ice retreat during this period is 1.2 ???C.","['Arctic', 'Tibetan Plateau', 'Himalayas', 'Tibet']"

Operational snow mapping using multitemporal Meteosat SEVIRI imagery,Received 23 June 2006; received in revised form 3 December 2006; accepted 5 December 2006 Abstract,"The advantage of geostationary satellites over polar orbiting satellites is the very high temporal frequency with which their instruments can monitor the Earth's surface. This property can be used to monitor changes that occur on a time scale of minutes to hours, like the movement and internal variation of clouds, and to capture all cloud-free moments. Thus, when instanta- neous images from geostationary satellites are combined into a composite image, cloud cover is reduced. The high temporal frequency can furthermore be used to improve the detection of clouds in instantaneous images. Many clouds are more variable in time than the surface and this property can be used to identify them. Traditional spectral classification masks all water clouds and many ice clouds, but fails to detect ice clouds with a similar spectral signature as snow. Change detection, on the other hand, masks most ice clouds and is not capable of detecting many water clouds. By combining both types of information virtually all cloud types can be detected.",[]

Optical properties of humiclike substances HULIS in biomassburning aerosols,"Abstract. We present here the optical properties of humic- like substances (HULIS) isolated from the fine fraction of biomass-burning aerosol collected in the Amazon basin dur- ing the LBA-SMOCC (Large scale Biosphere atmosphere experiment in Amazonia ?€? SMOke aerosols, Clouds, rainfall and Climate) experiment in September 2002. From the iso- lated HULIS, aerosol particles were generated and their scat- tering and absorption coefficients measured. The size dis- tribution and mass of the particles were also recorded. The value of the index of refraction was derived from ?€?closure?€? calculations based on particle size, scattering and absorption measurements. On average, the complex index of refraction at 532 nm of HULIS collected during day and nighttime was 1.65?€?0.0019i and 1.69?€?0.0016i, respectively. In addition, the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction was calcu- lated using the measured absorption coefficient of the bulk HULIS.","The absorption properties of the humic-like substances (HULIS) isolated from biomass burning aerosols were the same in day and nighttime samples. While the single scat- tering albedo of pure HULIS particles of about 50?€?60 nm di- ameter is high, about 0.98 at 532 nm, they still absorb light rather effectively in the UV and visible range. Hence, due to the strong spectral dependence of light absorption by HULIS (absorption A??ngstro??m exponent ???6.5) and due to the ele- vated amount of HULIS in biomass burning aerosol, a sig- nificant fraction of the light is absorbed by HULIS at shorter wavelengths. For instance, during the biomass burning pe- riod in the LBA-SMOCC campaign, up to 50% of the light absorption (at 300 nm) by aerosols in our study region in the Amazon basin is caused by (water-soluble) HULIS.

Optimized method for black carbon analysis in ice and snow using the Single Particle Soot Photometer,"Abstract. In this study we attempt to optimize the method for measuring black carbon (BC) in snow and ice using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). Beside the previously applied ultrasonic (CETAC) and Collison-type nebulizers we introduce a jet (Apex Q) nebulizer to aerosolize the aqueous sample for SP2 analysis. Both CETAC and Apex Q require small sample volumes (a few milliliters) which makes them suitable for ice core analysis. The Apex Q shows the least size-dependent nebulizing efficiency in the BC particle diam- eter range of 100?€?1000 nm. The CETAC has the advantage that air and liquid flows can be monitored continuously. All nebulizer-types require a calibration with BC standards for the determination of the BC mass concentration in unknown aqueous samples. We found Aquadag to be a suitable mate- rial for preparing calibration standards. Further, we studied the influence of different treatments for fresh discrete snow and ice samples as well as the effect of storage. The results show that samples are best kept frozen until analysis.

Origin and fluxes of atmospheric REE entering an ombrotrophic peat bog in Black Forest SW Germany Evidence from snow lichens and mosses,"The fate of the Rare Earth Elements (REE) were investigated in different types of archives of atmospheric deposition in the Black Forest, Southern Germany: (1) a 70 cm snow pack collected on the domed part of a raised bog and representing 2 months of snow accu- mulation, (2) a snow sample collected close to the road about 500 m from the peat bog, (3) two species of lichens and (4) a peat profile representing 400 years of peat accumulation as well as a ?€??€?preanthropogenic?€??€? sample and the living moss layer from the top of the core. REE concentrations in peat are significantly correlated to Ti which is a lithogenic conservative element suggesting that REE are immo- bile in peat bog environments. Snow, lichens and peat samples show similar PAAS (Post Archean Australian Shale) normalized REE distributions suggesting that the complete atmospheric REE signal is preserved in the peat profile. However, the annual flux of REE accumulated by the peat is ca. 10 times greater than that of the bulk winter flux of REE. This difference probably indicates that the REE concentrations in the snowpack are not representative of the average REE flux over the whole year. Despite the pronounced geo- logical differences between this site (granite host-rock) and a previously studied peat bog in Switzerland (limestone host-rock) similar REE distribution patterns and accumulation rates were found at both sites. Given that both sites confirm an Upper Continental Crust signature, the data suggests both sites are influenced by regional and not local, soil-derived lithogenic aerosols.",A record of about 350 years of REE accumulation has been studied in a peat bog in Southern Germany. The close correlation between REE and Ti which is a conservative lithogenic element in peat as well as no significant La EF (Ti) are evidence for the conservative behaviour and natu- ral origin of REE in peat.,"['Switzerland', 'Forest SW Germany', 'SW Germany', 'Black Forest SW Germany']"

Overview of NASAs MODIS and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite VIIRS snowcover earth system data records,"Abstract. Knowledge of the distribution, extent, duration and timing of snowmelt is critical for characterizing the Earth?€?s climate system and its changes. As a result, snow cover is one of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) essential climate variables (ECVs). Consistent, long-term datasets of snow cover are needed to study interannual variability and snow climatology. The NASA snow-cover datasets generated from the Moder- ate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are NASA Earth Sys- tem Data Records (ESDR). The objective of the snow-cover detection algorithms is to optimize the accuracy of mapping snow-cover extent (SCE) and to minimize snow-cover detection errors of omission and commission using automated, globally applied algorithms to produce SCE data products. Advancements in snow-cover map- ping have been made with each of the four major reprocessings of the MODIS data record, which extends from 2000 to the present. MODIS Collection 6 (C6; https://nsidc.org/data/modis/data_summaries) and VIIRS Collec- tion 1 (C1; https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP10.001) represent the state-of-the-art global snow-cover mapping algorithms and products for NASA Earth science. There were many revisions made in the C6 algorithms which improved snow-cover detection accuracy and information content of the data products. These improvements have also been incorporated into the NASA VIIRS snow-cover algorithms for C1. Both information content and us- ability were improved by including the Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) and a quality assurance (QA) data array of algorithm processing flags in the data product, along with the SCE map. The increased data content allows flexibility in using the datasets for specific regions and end-user applications. Though there are important differences between the MODIS and VIIRS instruments (e.g., the VIIRS 375 m native resolution compared to MODIS 500 m), the snow detection algorithms and data products are designed to be as similar as possible so that the 16+ year MODIS ESDR of global SCE can be extended into the future with the S-NPP VIIRS snow products and with products from future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) platforms. These NASA datasets are archived and accessible through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.","In this paper we highlight key changes in the snow-cover de- tection algorithm that have resulted in improvements and in- creased data content in the snow-cover products. A key im- provement in the MODIS C6 algorithm is the way in which the temperature screen is applied to eliminate errors of snow- cover omission on Northern Hemisphere mountains espe- cially during the spring and summer. Another notable im- provement is the use of the QIR algorithm applied to re- store data from nonfunctioning detectors in Aqua MODIS band 6, which is a key band for the calculation of NDSI in the basic snow-mapping algorithm. Those changes, along with changes that relate to QA and bit flag reporting, have been implemented to improve MODIS and NASA VIIRS snow-cover algorithms for global, automated SCE mapping from space, while minimizing the errors of omission and commission. The data content of the MODIS C6/VIIRS C1 snow-cover products include the NDSI_Snow_Cover dataset, which is the snow-cover map, and additional data layers that include the NDSI data and basic QA value and QA algorithm bit flags data. Increased data content allows flexibility in the use of the data for research and applica- tions. Details of the MODIS C6/NASA VIIRS C1 and earlier","['Aqua MODIS', 'Northern Hemisphere', 'Terra']"
Oxidation of black carbon by biotic and abiotic processes,"The objectives of this study were to assess the relative importance of either biotic or abiotic oxidation of biomass- derived black carbon (BC) and to characterize the surface properties and charge characteristics of oxidized BC. We incu- bated BC and BC?€?soil mixtures at two temperatures (30 ???C and 70 ???C), with and without microbial inoculation, nutrient addition, or manure amendment for four months. Abiotic processes were more important for oxidation of BC than biotic processes during this short-term incubation, as inoculation with microorganisms at 30 ???C did not change any of the mea- sured indicators of surface oxidation. Black C incubated at both 30 ???C and 70 ???C without microbial activity showed a decrease in pH (in water) from 5.4 to 5.2 and 3.4, as well as an increase in cation exchange capacity (CEC at pH 7) by 53% and 538% and in oxygen (O) content by 4% and 38%, respectively. Boehm titration and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy suggested that formation of carboxylic functional groups was the reason for the enhanced CEC dur- ing oxidation. Analysis of surface properties of BC using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the oxi- dation of BC particles was initiated on the surface. Incubation at 30 ???C only enhanced oxidation on particle surfaces, while oxidation during incubation at 70 ???C penetrated into the interior of particles. Such short-term oxidation of BC has signif- icance for the stability of BC in soils as well as for its effects on soil fertility and biogeochemistry. ??? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Abiotic processes were more important than bio- tic processes for the initial oxidation of fresh BC. This significant and rapid oxidation may have important implications for the stability of BC since further microbial decomposition may be less con- strained by the recalcitrance of aromatic ring struc- tures typical of BC. At the same time, cation retention was significantly enhanced, which would improve soil fertility. This oxidation is sufficiently rapid to make an application of fresh BC to soil fea- sible in order to enhance crop productivity and decrease potential off-site pollution in agricultural landscapes. Longer term laboratory and field stud- ies are needed to characterize and quantify further oxidation of BC to answer the question whether microbial decomposition of BC is facilitated by the initial abiotic oxidation.",[]

Partitioning of melt energy and meltwater fluxes in the ablation zone of the west Greenland ice sheet,"Abstract. We present four years (August 2003?€?August 2007) of surface mass balance data from the ablation zone of the west Greenland ice sheet along the 67??? N latitude cir- cle. Sonic height rangers and automatic weather stations con- tinuously measured accumulation/ablation and near-surface climate at distances of 6, 38 and 88 km from the ice sheet margin at elevations of 490, 1020 and 1520 m a.s.l. Using a melt model and reasonable assumptions about snow density and percolation characteristics, these data are used to quan- tify the partitioning of energy and mass fluxes during melt episodes. The lowest site receives very little winter accumu- lation, and ice melting is nearly continuous in June, July and August. Due to the lack of snow accumulation, little refreez- ing occurs and virtually all melt energy is invested in runoff. Higher up the ice sheet, the ice sheet surface freezes up dur- ing the night, making summer melting intermittent. At the intermediate site, refreezing in snow consumes about 10% of the melt energy, increasing to 40% at the highest site. The sum of these effects is that total melt and runoff increase ex- ponentially towards the ice sheet margin, each time doubling between the stations. At the two lower sites, we estimate that radiation penetration causes 20?€?30% of the ice melt to occur below the surface.",,"['west Greenland', 'Greenland']"

Permafrostaffected soils and their carbon pools with a focus on the Russian Arctic,"Abstract. Permafrost-affected soils have accumulated enor- mous pools of organic matter during the Quaternary pe- riod. The area occupied by these soils amounts to more than 8.6 million km2, which is about 27 % of all land ar- eas north of 50??? N. Therefore, permafrost-affected soils are considered to be one of the important cryosphere elements within the climate system. Due to the cryopedogenic pro- cesses that form these particular soils and the overlying veg- etation that is adapted to the arctic climate, organic mat- ter has accumulated to the present extent of up to 1024 Pg (1 Pg = 1015 g = 1 Gt) of soil organic carbon stored within the uppermost 3 m of ground. Considering the observed progres- sive climate change and the projected polar amplification, permafrost-affected soils will undergo fundamental property changes. Higher turnover and mineralisation rates of the or- ganic matter are consequences of these changes, which are expected to result in an increased release of climate-relevant trace gases into the atmosphere. The controversy of whether permafrost regions continue accumulating carbon or already function as a carbon source remains open until today. An increased focus on this subject matter, especially in under- represented Siberian regions, could contribute to a more ro- bust estimation of the soil organic carbon pool of permafrost regions and at the same time improve the understanding of the carbon sink and source functions of permafrost-affected soils.",,[]

Phenolic compounds in natural solutions of a coniferous forest,"Abstract?€?Phenolic compounds have been identified previously as potentially responsible for allelopathic interferences in spruce forest at high altitude. They have now been analyzed in canopy leachates, snow, and soil solutions col- lected from the three layers of the podsolic soil: OA, E. and B. Leachates were characterized by high tanning capacity and by p-hydroxyacetophenone (found at 10 '' M) also detected as the major (10 7 M) monomeric compound in snow. At least 10 phenolic monomers, including vanill ic, p-hydroxyben- zoic, and protocatechuic acids were identified in capillary waters extracted from the OA layer with their sum reaching 2 X 10 fi M. These monomers were only a small part (I %) of the total phenolics. In soil solutions, significant decreases in phenolic concentrations with depth were observed between the E and B layers, with qualitative modifications of the phenolic pattern. Spruce leachates and soil solutions exhibited high temporal variability, resulting in transitory allelopathic potential towards both aerial and subterranean parts of spruce seedlings. The occurrence of various and soluble phenolic coumpounds in the whole forest system, including -hydroxyacetophenone, which persist from green needles to soil solutions, suggests that they could be involved in complex and interactive processes occurring during organic matter accumu- lation on the coniferous forest floor.",,[]

Physically based model of the contribution of red snow algal cells to temporal changes in albedo in northwest Greenland,"Abstract. Surface albedo of snow and ice is substantially re- duced by inorganic impurities, such as aeolian mineral dust (MD) and black carbon (BC), and also by organic impuri- ties, such as microbes that live in the snow. In this paper, we present the temporal changes of surface albedo, snow grain size, MD, BC and snow algal cell concentration observed on a snowpack in northwest Greenland during the ablation season of 2014 and our attempt to reproduce the changes in albedo with a physically based snow albedo model. We also attempt to reproduce the effects of inorganic impurities and the red snow algae (Sanguina nivaloides) on albedo. Concen- trations of MD and red snow algae in the surface snow were found to increase in early August, while snow grain size and BC were found to not significantly change throughout the ablation season. Surface albedo was found to have decreased by 0.08 from late July to early August. The albedo simulated by the model agreed with the albedo observed during the study period. However, red snow algae exerted little effect on surface albedo in early August. This is probably owing to the abundance of smaller cells (4.9?? 104 cells L???1) when compared with the cell abundance of red snow reported by previous studies in the Arctic region (??? 108 cells L???1). The simulation of snow albedo until the end of the melting sea- son, with a snow algae model, revealed that the reduction in albedo attributed to red snow algae could equal 0.004, out of a total reduction of 0.102 arising from the three impurities on a snowpack in northwest Greenland. Finally, we conducted scenario simulations using the snow albedo model, coupled with the snow algae model, in order to simulate the possible effects of red snow blooming on snow albedo under warm","Temporal changes in snow albedo of Qaanaaq Glacier in northwest Greenland were calculated with a physical snow albedo model that incorporated the effect of three snow im- purities (MD, BC and snow algae).

Plant communities of a tussock tundra landscape in the Brooks Range Foothills Alaska,"Abstract. We present the first vegetation analysis from the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska according to the Braun- Blanquet approach. The data are from the Imnavait Creek and Toolik Lake regions.

Sum- mary floristic information is presented in a synoptic table. Five associations and 15 community types are tentatively placed into seven existing syntaxonomical classes. The com- munity descriptions are arranged according to habitat: dry exposed acidic sites, moist acidic shallow snowbeds, moist non-acidic snowbeds, moist acidic uplands, and moist non- acidic uplands. Many of the communities are Beringian vicariants of associations previously described from Green- land and the European Arctic. The described communities have a widespread distribution in northern Alaska. The rela- tionship of the associations to complex environmental gradi- ents are analyzed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Community composition is controlled primarily by meso- topographic relationships (slope position and soil moisture), microscale disturbances, and factors related to long-term land- scape evolution.",,"['Toolik Lake', 'Arctic Foothills', 'Range Foothills Alaska', 'Foothills Alaska', 'Alaska', 'Brooks Range Foothills Alaska', 'Imnavait Creek']"

Point observations of liquid water content in wet snowinvestigating methodical spatial and temporal aspects,"Abstract. Information about the volume and the spatial and temporal distribution of liquid water in snow is impor- tant for forecasting wet snow avalanches and for predicting melt-water run-off. The distribution of liquid water in snow is commonly estimated from point measurements using a ?€?hand?€? squeeze test, or a dielectric device such as a ?€?Snow Fork?€? or a ?€?Denoth meter?€?. Here we compare estimates of water content in the Swiss Alps made using the hand test to those made with a Snow Fork and a Denoth meter. Measure- ments were conducted in the Swiss Alps, mostly above tree line; more than 12 000 measurements were made at 85 loca- tions over 30 days. Results show that the hand test generally over estimates the volumetric liquid water content. Estimates using the Snow Fork are generally 1 % higher than those de- rived from the Denoth meter. The measurements were also used to investigate temporal and small-scale spatial patterns of wetness. Results show that typically a single point mea- surement does not characterize the wetness of the surround- ing snow. Large diurnal changes in wetness are common in the near-surface snow, and associated changes at depth were also observed. A single vertical profile of measurements is not sufficient to determine whether these changes were a re- sult of a spatially homogeneous wetting front or caused by in- filtration through pipes. Based on our observations, we sug- gest that three measurements at horizontal distances greater than 50 cm are needed to adequately characterize the distri- bution of liquid water through a snowpack. Further, we sug- gest a simplified classification scheme that includes five wet- ness patterns that incorporate both the vertical and horizontal distribution of liquid water in a snowpack.","Methodical, spatial and temporal aspects must be considered when observing snow wetness in the field and interpreting wetness information.",['Swiss Alps']

Possible impacts of snow darkening effects on the hydrological cycle over western Eurasia and East Asia,"Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the possible impact of snow darkening effect (SDE) by light-absorbing aerosols on the regional changes of the hydrological cycle over Eurasia using the NASA GEOS-5 Model with aerosol tracers and a state-of-the-art snow darkening module, the Goddard SnoW Impurity Module (GOSWIM) for the land surface. Two sets of ten-member ensemble experiments for 10 years were carried out forced by prescribed sea surface temperature (2002?€?2011) with different atmospheric initial conditions, with and without SDE, respectively. Results show that SDE can exert a significant regional influence in partitioning the contributions of evaporative and advective processes on the hydrological cycle, during spring and summer season. Over western Eurasia, SDE-induced rainfall increase during early spring can be largely explained by the increased evaporation from snowmelt. Rainfall, however, decreases in early summer due to the reduced evaporation as well as moisture divergence and atmospheric subsidence associated with the development of an anomalous mid- to upper-tropospheric anticyclonic circulation. On the other hand, in the East Asian monsoon region, moisture advection from the adjacent ocean is a main contributor to rainfall increase in the melting season. A warmer land-surface caused by earlier snowmelt and subsequent drying further increases moisture transport and convergence significantly enhancing rainfall over the region. Our findings suggest that the SDE may play an important role in leading to hotter and drier summers over western Eurasia, through coupled land-atmosphere interaction, while enhancing East Asian summer monsoonal precipitation via enhanced land-ocean thermal contrast and moisture transport due to the SDE-induced warmer Eurasian continent.","Based on the global climate model simulation using the NASA GEOS-5, we have examined the possible impact of snow darkening effect (SDE) by light-absorbing aerosols (LAAs) on the regional dependency of the hydrological cycle over Eurasia. In particular, this study analyzed the characteristics of precipitation and its changes in two regions (west of Eurasia and East Asia) during spring and summer. The recycling ratio was used to determine the characteristics of precipitation by region. This method was described in previous studies as a good indicator of the interaction between the surface and the atmosphere.","['East Asia', 'Eurasia']"

Potential of reflected GNSS signals for ice sheet remote sensing,"Abstract?€?Earth-reflected GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Sys- tem) signals have become an attractive tool for remote sensing, e.g., ocean altimetry and scatterometric ocean wind measurements. For ice sheets, the large penetration capability and the large-scale surface averaging of the L-band signals could open a new look on firnpack characteristics like accumulation rates. In this paper we investigate theoretically reflections of GPS (Global Positioning System) signals from ice sheets. We derive a model of the reflection signal and perform simulations of airborne and spaceborne measurements. The results show that the signal, though complex, is sensitive to the roughness of the snow surface (and internal interfaces) and to firn parameters like accumulation rates. To extract valuable and concise information from the complex signal, we derive an example procedure that focusses on particular ground zones during a satellite receiver pass. The results indicate that it should be possible in principle to separately infer sur- face and firnpack parameters from the measurements. We conclude that GNSS reflections over ice sheets should be further persued, in particular by obtaining experimental data.",,[]

Preferential deposition of snow and dust over hills Governing processes and relevant scales,"Abstract Preferential deposition of snow and dust over complex terrain is responsible for a wide range of environmental processes and accounts for a significant source of uncertainty in the surface mass balances of cold and arid regions. Despite the growing body of literature on the subject, previous studies reported contradictory results on the location and magnitude of deposition maxima and minima. This study aims at unraveling the governing processes of preferential deposition in a neutrally stable atmosphere and to reconcile seemingly inconsistent results of previous works. For this purpose, a comprehensive modeling approach is developed, based on large eddy simulations of the turbulent airflow, Lagrangian stochastic model of particle trajectories, and immersed boundary method to represent the underlying topography. The model is tested against wind tunnel measurements of dust deposition around isolated and sequential hills. A scale analysis is then performed to investigate the dependence of snowfall deposition on the particle Froude and Stokes numbers, which fully account for the governing processes of inertia, flow advection, and gravity. Model results suggest that different deposition patterns emerge from different combinations of dimensionless parameters, with deposition maxima located either on the windward or the leeward slope of the hill. Additional simulations are performed, to test whether the often used assumption of inertialess particles yields accurate deposition patterns. Results indicate that this assumption can be justified when snowflakes present dendritic shape but may generate unrealistic results for rounded particles. We finally show that our scale analysis provides qualitatively similar results for hills with different aspect ratios.",,[]

Pulse electrodeposition of nanocrystalline nickel using ultra narrow pulse width and high peak current density,"The synthesis of nanocrystalline nickel by electrodeposition has been studied for more than 10 years.

Pulse plating with ultra narrow pulse width and high peak current density was employed to increase the deposition current density and the nucleation rate. At an on-time of 10 ms and an off-time of 90 ms, it was found that different surface morphologies, grain sizes, textures, and hardness were obtained at different current densities.

Quantifying bioalbedo a new physically based model and discussions of empirical methods for characterising biological influence on ice and snow albedo,"Abstract. The darkening effects of biological impurities on ice and snow have been recognised as a control on the sur- face energy balance of terrestrial snow, sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets. With a heightened interest in understanding the impacts of a changing climate on snow and ice processes, quantifying the impact of biological impurities on ice and snow albedo (?€?bioalbedo?€?) and its evolution through time is a rapidly growing field of research. However, rigorous quantification of bioalbedo has remained elusive because of difficulties in isolating the biological contribution to ice albedo from that of inorganic impurities and the variable op- tical properties of the ice itself. For this reason, isolation of the biological signature in reflectance data obtained from aerial/orbital platforms has not been achieved, even when ground-based biological measurements have been available. This paper provides the cell-specific optical properties that are required to model the spectral signatures and broadband darkening of ice. Applying radiative transfer theory, these properties provide the physical basis needed to link biolog- ical and glaciological ground measurements with remotely sensed reflectance data. Using these new capabilities we con- firm that biological impurities can influence ice albedo, then we identify 10 challenges to the measurement of bioalbedo in the field with the aim of improving future experimental designs to better quantify bioalbedo feedbacks.

Quantifying dust emissions from desert landforms eastern Mojave Desert USA,,"Based on our comprehensive data set of dust emissions, we demonstrate that in the Mojave Desert alluvial sources such as dry washes and distal alluvial fans are much larger contributors to atmospheric dust loading compared to other landforms, particularly playas. Playas themselves are extremely heterogeneous with regards to dust emissions, with the highest emissions occurring on the coarser-grained playa margins that have been overlooked as a potentially large source of dust. The PI-SWERL allows for heteroge- neity of dust emissions to be quantified. Dust emissions may vary by up to three orders of magnitude on individual landforms, primarily as a function of grain-size distribution and surface conditions such as strength and continuity of surface crusts. Additional data using the PI- SWERL should be collected to build an evenmore robust field data set, especially from known emission hotspots. Other considerations should include measurements from landforms that may capture seasonal changes in dust flux. Dust flux measurements made by PI- SWERL can provide modelers information related to the range and magnitude of dust produced from desert landforms, potentially validating modeling approaches. Magnitudes can be adjusted if independent information related to vegetation density or surface roughness is known.","['Mojave Desert USA', 'Desert USA', 'Mojave Desert']"

The distinctive tem- poral and spatial nature of these impacts is not captured by measures that rely on global averages or long time integra- tions. Here, we propose a simple measure, the Specific Forc- ing Pulse (SFP), to quantify climate warming or cooling by these pollutants, where we define ?€?immediate?€? as occurring primarily within the first year after emission. SFP is the amount of energy added to or removed from a receptor re- gion in the Earth-atmosphere system by a chemical species, per mass of emission in a source region. We limit the applica- tion of SFP to species that remain in the atmosphere for less than one year. Metrics used in policy discussions, such as total forcing or global warming potential, are easily derived from SFP. However, SFP conveys purely physical informa- tion without incurring the policy implications of choosing a time horizon for the global warming potential.",,[]
Quantifying light absorption of iron oxides and carbonaceous aerosol in seasonal snow across Northern China,"Abstract: In this study, we attempted to quantify light absorption by insoluble light-absorbing particles (ILAPs) such as black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and iron oxides in snow using an optical method directly and compared the results with those obtained using optical and chemical analysis methods cooperatively in previous studies. The mass absorption coefficients (MACs) and absorption ??ngstr??m exponents (AAEs) of pure hematite, goethite and fullerene soot were also measured using an integrating sphere/integrating sandwich (ISSW) spectrophotometer in the laboratory. The results indicated that the MACs of pure hematite and goethite are 0.97 ?? 0.02 m2??g???1 and 0.43 ?? 0.01 m2??g???1 at 550 nm, and their AAEs are 5.53 ?? 0.47 and 2.18 ?? 0.16 from 550 nm to 750 nm, respectively. The MAC and AAE of fullerene soot are 6.40 ?? 0.42 m2??g???1 at 550 nm and 0.54 ?? 0.06 from 450 to 750 nm. By using the regionally average AAEs of non-BC components in snow, we evaluated the performance of a directly optical analysis, rather than combination of the optical and chemical methods, in quantifying the light absorption of BC, OC and Fe in snow samples. We found that the directly optical method used to measure the light absorption of BC and OC in Northern China snow has substantially low biases of 6.29% and 4.27% in median comparing to previous method. However, the high biases in estimating light absorption of Fe (33.01%) may be associated with the significant underestimation of the AAE of Fe."," The MACs and AAEs of goethite, hematite and fullerene soot were measured using an ISSW",['Northern China']

QuasiNewtonian dust cosmologies,"Exact dynamical equations for a generic dust matter source field in a cosmological context are formulated with respect to a non-comoving Newtonian-like timelike reference congruence and investi- gated for internal consistency. On the basis of a lapse function N (the relativistic acceleration scalar potential) which evolves along the reference congruence according to N?? = ????N (?? = const), we find that consistency of the quasi-Newtonian dynamical equations is not attained at the first derivative level. We then proceed to show that a self-consistent set can be obtained by linearising the dynamical equations about a (non-comoving) FLRW background. In this case, on properly accounting for the first-order momentum density relating to the non-relativistic peculiar motion of the matter, addi- tional source terms arise in the evolution and constraint equations describing small-amplitude energy density fluctuations that do not appear in similar gravitational instability scenarios in the standard literature.","Put in loose terms, in this article we have asked the question as to what extent we can squeeze a generic dust matter source field, which typically generates non-zero ????, ????ab, ????",[]
Radar measurements of snow Experiment and analysis,"Abstract?€? This paper considers two specific types of exp- eriments conducted to improve our understanding of radar backscatter from snow-covered ground surfaces. The first experiment involves radar backscatter measurements at C- and X-band of artificial snow of varying depths. The relatively simple target characteristics, combined with an exhaustive ground truth effort, make the results of this experiment especially amenable to comparison with predictions based on theoretical methods for modeling volume-scattering media. It is shown that both conventional and dense-medium radiative transfer models fail to adequately explain the observed results. A direct polarimetric inversion approach is described by which the characteristics of the snow medium are extracted from the measured data. The second type of experiment examined in this study involves diurnal backscatter measurements that were made contemporaneously with detailed measurements of the snow-wetness depth profiles of the observed scene. These data are used to evaluate the capability of a recently proposed algorithm for snow wetness retrieval from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements, which has hithertofore been applied only to data from very complex and extended mountainous terrains.",,[]
Radiation damage from EELS and NEXAFS in diesel soot and diesel soot extracts,"Carbon NEXAFS and EELS spectra of soot, and NEXAFS spectra of soot extracts, are presented. The EELS spectra of solid soot particles from a TEM-EELS show fewer structures than the corresponding NEXAFS spectra obtained at two different synchrotron beamlines. We attribute radiation damage in the TEM-EELS to the failure at resolving structures of surface functional carbon groups in or on soot. NEXAFS spectra of soot extracts studied with a scanning transmission X-ray microscope show alterations during X-ray exposure, which can be explained by a simple chemical model where oxygen apparently reacts with the sample. When the same extract is studied in an ultrahigh-vacuum beamline, no such alterations are observed. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,[]

Radiative forcing by contrails,"Abstract. A parametric study of the instantaneous radiative impact of contrails is presented using three di???erent radiative transfer models for a series of model atmospheres and cloud parameters. Contrails are treat- ed as geometrically and optically thin plane parallel homogeneous cirrus layers in a static atmosphere. The ice water content is varied as a function of ambient temperature. The model atmospheres include tropical, mid-latitude, and subarctic summer and winter atmo- spheres. Optically thin contrails cause a positive net forcing at top of the atmosphere. At the surface the radiative forcing is negative during daytime. The forcing increases with the optical depth and the amount of contrail cover. At the top of the atmosphere, a mean contrail cover of 0.1% with average optical depth of 0.2 to 0.5 causes about 0.01 to 0.03 Wm","Major parameters in??uencing static radiative forcing due to contrails were identi??ed from a model study.

Fine-mode AOD and AAOD show less agreement with observations, with large underesti- mates for AAOD. Analysis of AOD trends suggests that most models realistically reproduce changes over North America and Europe during the last few decades, while results for Asia are more ambiguous as the observations are highly sen- sitive to the satellite analysis methodology. Many of the AC- CMIP models do not include nitrate and SOA, which is a primary cause of the general low bias in aerosols, though there are also clear underestimates of AOD in biomass burn- ing regions.

The equipment that was used to do that and many of the problems that were solved in the process have been presented. Two-minute profiles of the water vapor mixing ratio and aerosol backscattering ratio from the surface to 7 km have also been presented. These profiles were then composited to form color images to aid in the visualization of the temporal and spatial variation of both the moisture and aerosol fields.

Realtime rendering of accumulated snow,"Animation is often done by setting up a sequence of key orienta- tions, represented by quaternions. The in between orientations are obtained by spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) of the quater- nions, which then can be used to rotate the objects. However, SLERP involves the computation of trigonometric functions, which are computationally expensive. Since it is often required that the an- gle between each quaternion should be the same, we propose that incremental SLERP is used instead. In this paper we demonstrate five different methods for incremental SLERP, whereof one is new, and their pros and cons are discussed.","The surface renderer that we have developed can be used for in- teractive editing of segmented objects. The efficiency lies mainly in the surface tracking and the index caching strategies. However, we note that when complex objects are triangulated, the huge num- ber of triangles considerably slows down the rendering. To over- come this problem we will investigate how a triangle decimation algorithm could be incorporated and how the re-rendering can be improved to update only parts of the triangle mesh.",[]

Reconstructing the mass balance of Brewster Glacier New Zealand using MODISderived glacierwide albedo,"Abstract. In New Zealand, direct measurements of mass bal- ance are sparse due to the inaccessibility of glaciers in the Southern Alps and the logistical difficulties associated with maintaining a mass balance record. In order to explore the benefit of remotely sensed imaging to monitor mass bal- ance in the Southern Alps, this research assesses the rela- tionship between measurements of glacier surface albedo de- rived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiome- ter (MODIS) and mass balance observations using the glacio- logical method on Brewster Glacier over the 2005?€?2013 pe- riod. We confirm that minimum glacier-wide albedo is a re- liable predictor for annual mass balance in this maritime en- vironment (R2 = 0.93). Furthermore, we show that regular monitoring of glacier-wide albedo enables a new metric of winter accumulation to be derived, namely the cumulative winter albedo, which is found to correlate strongly with win- ter mass balance (R2 = 0.88), thus enabling the reconstruc- tion of separate winter and summer mass balance records. This allows the mass balance record for Brewster Glacier to be extended back to the start of MODIS observations in 2000 and to confirm that the annual balance of Brewster Glacier is largely controlled by summer balance (R2= 92 %). An ap- plication of the extended record is proposed whereby the re- lationship between mass balance and the photographic record of the end-of-summer snowline altitude is assessed. This al- lowed the annual balance record of Brewster Glacier to be reconstructed over the period 1977?€?2013, thus providing the longest record of mass balance for a glacier in New Zealand.","In this study, we assessed the validity of the MODImLab albedo retrieval algorithm using the 2-year-long record of albedo on Brewster Glacier, New Zealand. As part of the accuracy assessment, we tested the sensitivity of MODIS- derived albedo measurements to illumination/viewing geom- etry, anisotropic reflectance of snow and ice, and omission er- rors in the cloud masking algorithm. The results show that the main source of error originates from the growing footprint of MODIS pixels with increasing viewing angles that yield an underestimation of retrieved albedo, likely due to spec- tral mixture with nearby rocks. Overall, the accuracy of the albedo retrieval was found to decrease from RMSD= 0.07 in clear-sky conditions to RMSD= 0.115 when relying on the MODImLab cloud mask. Despite gross errors due to cloud omission, the reliance on the MODImLab cloud mask did not appear to compromise the albedo sequence, confirming it","['New Zealand', 'Southern Alps', 'Glacier New Zealand', 'Brewster Glacier New Zealand', 'New Zealand.']"
Reconstruction of remotely sensed snow albedo for quality improvements based on a combination of forward and retrieval models,"Abstract?€? Snow albedo plays an important role in the global climate system. There are notable missing data and error uncertainties in the current remote sensing snow albedo products that are attributed to the limits of remote-sensing technology. Due to the uncertainties of meteorological factors and the differences in various forward model simulation methods, snow albedo forward simulations also have considerable uncertainties. This paper suggests a long-time-series reconstruction of snow albedo utilizing a forward radiation-transferring model and a remote- sensing retrieval model together with multisource remotely sensed data and meteorological data. The key to this paper is to estimate snow information for areas lacking data utilizing a forward model for snow albedo with clear physical mechanisms. The estimated snow information can be used as reliable data for snow albedo reconstructions. The results indicate that the long time series of snow albedo data obtained by coupling the snow albedo retrieval model and forward simulation model is highly accurate. The mean absolute error, root mean square error, Pearson?€?s correlation coefficient (R), and Nash?€?Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the observed and reconstructed snow albedos are 0.11, 0.14, 0.79, and 0.69, respectively. The reconstructed snow albedo data are underestimated by only 11% relative to the in situ snow surface albedo measurements. In the alpine mountain regions, the proposed method has a simulation accuracy that is 6% greater than that of the MOD10A1 SAD. This paper provides",,[]

The model has a high accuracy out of the principal plane for the observation zenith angles smaller than 60 . However, the accuracy is reduced in the principal plane. Specular light reflection by partially oriented snow plates on the snow surface not accounted for by the model can play a role for measurements in the principal plane.

Reflective properties of white sea ice and snow,"Abstract. White ice (ice with a highly scattering granular layer on top of its surface) and snow-covered ice occupy a large part of the sea ice area in the Arctic, the former in summer, the latter in the cold period. The inherent optical properties (IOPs) and the reflectance of these types of ice are considered from the point of view of the light scattering and radiative transfer theories. The IOPs ?€? the extinction and ab- sorption coefficients and the scattering phase function ?€? are derived with the assumption that both the snow cover and the scattering layer of white ice are random mixtures of air and ice with the characteristic grain size significantly larger than the wavelength of incident light. Simple analytical formu- las are put forward to calculate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), albedo at direct incidence (the directional?€? hemispherical reflectance), and albedo at diffuse incidence (the bihemispherical reflectance). The optical model devel- oped is verified with the data of the in situ measurements made during the R/V Polarstern expedition ARK-XXVII/3 in 2012.","This work presents the optical model of white ice, i.e., any kind of ice covered with the scattering layer that consists of ice grains mixed with air.

Refractory black carbon mass concentrations in snow and ice method evaluation and intercomparison with elemental carbon measurement,"Abstract. Accurate measurement of black carbon (BC) mass concentrations in snow and ice is crucial for the assessment of climatic impacts. However, it is difficult to compare meth- ods used to assess BC levels in the literature as they are not the same. The single particle soot photometer (SP2) method appears to be one of the most suitable to measure low con- centrations of BC in snow and ice. In this paper, we evalu- ated a method for the quantification of refractory BC (rBC) in snow and ice samples coupling the SP2 with the APEX-Q nebulizer. The paper reviews all the steps of rBC determina- tion, including SP2 calibration, correction for rBC particle aerosolization efficiency (75 ?? 7 % using the APEX-Q neb- ulizer), and treatment of the samples. In addition, we com- pare the SP2 method and the thermal?€?optical method ?€? Sun- set organic carbon (OC) / elemental carbon (EC) aerosol ana- lyzer with EUSAAR2 protocol ?€? using snow and firn samples with different characteristics from the Greenland Summit, the French Alps, the Caucasus, and the Himalayas. Careful investigation was undertaken of analytical artifacts that po- tentially affect both methods. The SP2-based rBC quantifi- cation may be underestimated when the SP2 detection range does not cover correctly the existing size distribution of the sample. Thermal?€?optical EC measurements can be underes- timated by low filtration efficiency of quartz fiber filter be- fore analysis or dust properties (concentration and type), and overestimated by pyrolyzed OC artifacts during EC analysis. These results underline the need for careful assessment of the analytical technique and procedure for correct data interpre- tation.","We evaluated an rBC measurement methodology coupling jet nebulizer (APEX-Q) and the SP2 analyzer, through an extended series of tests using both rBC standard material and various types of snow and firn collected from differ- ent glaciers worldwide.

Reindeer Rangifer tarandus and climate change importance of winter forage,"Abstract: As a consequence of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, climate change is predicted to be particularly pronounced, although regionally variable, in the vast arctic, sub-arctic and alpine tundra areas of the northern hemi- sphere. Here, we review winter foraging conditions for reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) living in these areas, and consider diet, forage quality and distribution, accessibility due to snow variation, and effects of snow condition on reindeer and caribou populations. Finally, we hypothesise how global warming may affect wild mountain reindeer herds in South Norway. Energy-rich lichens often dominate reindeer and caribou diets. The animals also prefer lichens, and their productivity has been shown to be higher on lichen-rich than on lichen-poor ranges. Nevertheless, this ener- gy source appears to be neither sufficient as winter diet for reindeer or caribou (at least for pregnant females) nor nec- essary. Some reindeer and caribou populations seem to be better adapted to a non-lichen winter diet, e.g. by a larger alimentary tract. Shrubs appear to be the most common alternative winter forage, while some grasses appear to rep- resent a good, nutritionally-balanced winter diet. Reindeer/caribou make good use of a wide variety of plants in win- ter, including dead and dry parts that are digested more than expected based on their fibre content. The diversity of winter forage is probably important for the mineral content of the diet. A lichen-dominated winter diet may be defi- cient in essential dietary elements, e.g. minerals. Sodium in particular may be marginal in inland winter ranges. Our review indicates that most Rangifer populations with lichen-dominated winter diets are either periodically or contin- uously heavily harvested by humans or predators. However, when population size is mainly limited by food, accessi- ble lichen resources are often depleted. Plant studies simulating climatic change indicate that a warmer, wetter cli- mate may cause an altitudinal upward shift in the production of mat-forming lichens in alpine, sub-arctic regions. This is due to an increased potential for lichen growth at high altitudes, combined with increased competition from taller-growing vascular plants at lower altitudes, where the biomass of Betula nana in particular will increase. Mat- forming lichens dominant on dry, windblown ridges are easily overgrazed at high reindeer densities. This has long- term effects due to lichens?€? slow regeneration rate, but may also reduce competition from vascular plants in a long time perspective. Fires may act in a similar way in some forested areas. Accessibility of winter forage depends on plant biomass, snow depth and hardness; ice crusts or exceptionally deep snow may result in starvation and increased ani- mal mortality. Calf recruitment appears to be low and/or highly variable where winter ranges are overgrazed and hard or deep snow is common. Population decline in several Rangifer tarandus spp. has been associated with snow-rich win- ters. Effects tend to be delayed and cumulative, particularly on calves. This is mainly ascribed to feeding conditions for young animals which later affect age at maturation. Global warming may increase the frequency of deep or hard snow on reindeer ranges in Norway, due to increased precipitation and more frequent mild periods in winter. We hypothesise that potential benefits from increased plant productivity due to global warming will be counteracted by shifts in the distribution of preferred lichen forage, reduction of the areas of suitable winter ranges, and generally reduced forage accessibility in winter.",,['Rangifer']

Remote sensing for snow hydrology in China Challenges and perspectives,"Abstract. Snow is one of the most important components of the cryosphere. Remote sensing of snow focuses on the retrieval of snow parameters and monitoring of variations in snow using satellite data. These parameters are key inputs for hydrological and atmospheric models. Over the past 30 years, the field of snow remote sensing has grown dramatically in China. The 30-year achievements of research in different aspects of snow remote sensing in China, especially in (1) methods of retrieving snow cover, snow depth/snow water equivalent, and grain size and (2) applications to snowmelt runoff modeling, snow response on climate change, and remote sensing monitoring of snow-caused disasters are reviewed/summarized. The importance of the first remote sensing experiment on snow parameters at the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin, in 2008, is also highlighted. A series of experiments, referred to as the Cooperative Observation Series for Snow (COSS), focus on some key topics on remote sensing of snow. COSS has been implemented for 3 years and will continue in different snow pattern regions of China. The snow assimilation system has been established in some regions using advanced ensemble Kalman filters. Finally, an outlook for the future of remote sensing of snow in China is given. ??

Remote sensing of tropospheric aerosols from space Past present and future,,"The recently rediscovered importance of tropo- spheric aerosol as a major source of uncertainty in the radiative forcing of climate and hence the prediction of climate change has fueled a resurgence of interest in the remote sensing of tropospheric aerosols from space. In the past we have primarily been restricted to using uncalibrated sensors that were not designed for the remote sensing of tropospheric aerosols, or to large field-of-view ultraviolet spectrometers that provide a useful aerosol index not easily converted to an aero- sol optical thickness needed by climate models.

Resilience and vulnerability of permafrost to climate change," Abstract: The resilience and vulnerability of permafrost to climate change depends on complex interactions among topog- raphy, water, soil, vegetation, and snow, which allow permafrost to persist at mean annual air temperatures (MAATs) as high as +2 ??C and degrade at MAATs as low as -20??C. To assess these interactions, we compiled existing data and tested effects of varying conditions on mean annual surface temperatures (MASTs) and 2 m deep temperatures (MADTs) through modeling, Surface water had the largest effect, with water sediment temperatures being ~10 oC above MAAT. A 50% re- duction in snow depth reduces MADT by 2 DC.Elevation changes between 200 and 800 m increases MAAT by up to 2,3 DC and snow depths by ~40%. Aspect caused only a ~1??C difference in MAST. Covarying vegetation structure, or- ganic matter thickness, soil moisture. and snow depth of terrestrial ecosystems, ranging from barren silt to white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) forest to tussock shrub, affect MASTs by ~6??C and MADTs by ~7??C. Groundwater at 2- 7 ??C greatly affects lateral and internal permafrost thawing. Analyses show that vegetation succession provides strong neg- ative feedbacks that make permafrost resilient to even large increases in air temperatures. Surface water, which is affected by topography and ground ice, provides even stronger negative feedbacks that make permafrost vulnerable to thawing even under cold temperatures.","warming is complicated by the complex interaction of bio- physical factors, which create strong negative feedbacks from vegetation and soil processes that make permafrost more resilient to climate warming and disturbance and posi- tive feedbacks from thaw settlement and water impound- ment that make permafrost more vulnerable to warming, Vegetation and soil feedbacks can reduce deep soil temper- atures by 7 oC and help permafrost to persist at MAATs of up to +2 'C, while water impounded by thaw settlement can increase ground temperatures by 10 ~C and make permafrost vulnerable to thawing at MAATs as low as -20oC.",[]

Retention and radiative forcing of black carbon in eastern Sierra Nevada snow,,"Measurements in a time series of snow pits in the eastern Sierra Nevada of California in 2009 indicate that total rBC in the snowpack increases during snow accumulation. Conti- nental dust concentrations measured only in the top 30 cm of the snow pits indicate that dust also increases during the snow accumulation period. In contrast to the major ionic species, which were flushed from the snowpack soon after snowmelt began, rBC and dust were retained in the snowpack well into the ablation season. This enhanced concentrations near the surface until a final flush of melt water near the end of May 2009 (Fig. 2a). Potential mechanisms for this effect may be chemical or physical in nature. For the former, initially hy- drophobic rBC may not be sufficiently aged until well into the ablation period to be attracted to water and flush with melt flux. For the latter, vigorous melt water flow that oc- curs later in the melt season may be required to overcome the repulsive effect of rBC hydrophobicity. The observation that both rBC and dust were flushed concurrently suggests that more vigorous and ubiquitous melt water flow may be the dominant process. While some correlation exists between different layers of the snowpack, both temporal and spatial","['California', 'Sierra Nevada']"

Retrieval of snow albedo and grain size using reflectance measurements in Himalayan basin,"In the present paper spectral reflectance measurements of Himalayan seasonal snow were carried out and analysed to retrieve the snow albedo and effective grain size. The asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) theory was applied to retrieve the plane and spherical albedo. The retrieved plane albedo was compared with the measured spec-5 tral albedo and a good agreement was observed with ??10% measured error accuracy. Retrieved integrated albedo was found within ??6% difference with ground observed broadband albedo. The snow grain sizes retrieved using different models based on ART theory are compared for different snow types and it was observed that presently grain size model using two channel method (one in visible and another in NIR region)10 can work well for Himalayan seasonal snow and it was found consistence with temporal increased grain size. This method can work very well for clean dry snow like in upper Himalaya but sometime due to low reflectances (<0.2) using wavelength 1.24 ??m ART theory can not be applied, which is common in lower and middle Himalayan old snow. This study is of importance for monitoring the Himalayan cryosphere using air-borne15 or space-borne sensors.","The main advantage of the ART theory is analytical solutions of the radiative trans- fer theory for retrieving the snow properties. This makes the fast retrievals instead of running radiative transfer codes. Therefore this technique can be used to generate10 the operational snowcover grain size and albedo maps using airborne or spaceborne mutispectral sensor data. Before directly applying the theory to retrieve the snow prop- erties from satellite data of Himalayan region, it was an important step to understand how it behaves for the different types of seasonal snow.",['Himalaya']
Retrieval of snow grain size and albedo of western Himalayan snow cover using satellite data,"In the present study we describe the retrievals of snow grain size and spectral albedo (plane and spherical albedo) for Western Himalayan snow cover using Hyperion sen- sor data. The asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) theory was explored for the snow retrievals. To make the methodology operational only five spectral bands (440, 500,5 1050, 1240 and 1650 nm) of Hyperion were used for snow parameters retrieval. The bi- spectral method (440 nm in the visible and 1050/1240 nm in the NIR region) was used to retrieve snow grain size. Spectral albedos were retrieved using satellite reflectances and estimated grain size. A good agreement was observed between retrieved snow pa- rameters and ground observed snow-meteorological conditions. The satellite retrieved10 grain sizes were compared with field spectroradiometer retrieved grain sizes and close results were found for Lower Himalayan snow. The wavelength 1240 nm was found to be more suitable compared to 1050 nm for grain size retrieval along the steep slopes. The methodology was able to retrieve the spatial variations in snow parameters in dif- ferent parts of Western Himalaya which are due to snow climatic and terrain conditions15 of Himalaya.

Retrieving forest background reflectance in a boreal region from Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR data,Received 26 January 2006; received in revised form 7 July 2006; accepted 31 July 2006 Abstract,"Multi-angle remote sensing can be a very useful way to characterize ecosystems not only for the forest canopy but also for the underlying background. The MISR data provides bidirectional reflectance of forest canopies in an oblique plane relative to the sun and indicates the hotspot and the darkspot behavior of the forest canopies as well as the influence of the background to the bidirectional reflectance. The Four-Scale model has proven its ability to run with fixed general parameters to quantify the probabilities of viewing illuminated tree crown and background for estimating the background reflectivity. As expected, in summer, the background reflectivities in red and NIR showed greening processes and that are closer to the growing pattern of adjacent grasslands. More precise result could be achieved when the more detail parameters are available for each vegetation cover type. The color composite of background reflectivity is an interesting outcome and this can be used to classify the background component of a forest pixel. The classification of a background image requires systematic ground information and further studies may be possible to classify rock, soil, grass, moss, bush, water, etc. based on retrieved optical properties of the background. When this additional background information is combined with the conventional multispectral remote sensing data, the accuracy of mapping biophysical parameters for terrestrial ecosystems can be greatly improved, and therefore, this use of multiple angle data can eventually help to address key issues of the spatial distribution of vegetation productivity and the impact of climate change on the global terrestrial carbon budget.",[]

Review and uncertainty assessment of sizeresolved scavenging coefficient formulations for snow scavenging of atmospheric aerosols,"Theoretical parameterizations for the size-resolved scavenging coefficient for atmo- spheric aerosol particles scavenged by snow (??snow) need assumptions regarding (i) snow particle?€?aerosol particle collection efficiency E , (ii) snow particle size distribution N(Dp), (iii) snow particle terminal velocity VD, and (iv) snow particle cross-sectional5 area A. Existing formulas for these parameters are reviewed in the present study and uncertainties in ??snow caused by various combinations of these parameters are as- sessed. Different formulations of E can cause uncertainties in ??snow of more than one order of magnitude for all aerosol sizes for typical snowfall intensities. E is the largest source of uncertainty among all the input parameters, similar to rain scavenging of at-10 mospheric aerosols (??rain) as was found in a previous study by Wang et al. (2010). However, other parameters can also cause significant uncertainties in ??snow, and the uncertainties from these parameters are much larger than for ??rain. Specifically, differ- ent N(Dp) formulations can cause one-order-of-magnitude uncertainties in ??snow for all aerosol sizes, as is also the case for a combination of uncertainties from both VD and A.15 In comparison, uncertainties in ??rain from N(Dp) are smaller than a factor of 5 and those from VD are smaller than a factor of 2. ??snow estimated from one empirical formula gen- erated from field measurements falls in the upper range of, or is slightly higher than, theoretically estimated values. The predicted aerosol concentrations obtained using different ??snow formulas can differ by a factor of two for just a one-centimeter snowfall20 (liquid water equivalent of approximately 1 mm). It is likely that, for typical rain and snow event the removal of atmospheric aerosol particles by snow is more effective than re- moval by rain for equivalent precipitation amounts, although a firm conclusion requires much more evidence.",,"['??snow', '??rain']"
Review article Synergy in remote sensingwhats in a pixel,"Abstract. We address various questions that arise from the fact that a pixel ?? or the related instantaneous ?? eld-of-view (IFOV) on the ground?? is often larger than we would like it to be. The problems arise as a penalty imposed by technology for the fact that a spacecraft gives an overview of a very large area. We study the question of why the pixel size is important when one studies satellite imagery and also some questions related to the factors that contribute to the recorded signal in a remotely-sensed data set. This includes a discussion of the instantaneous ?? eld-of-view, both from the simple geometrical point of view and from a more physical point of view. It also involves a study of the point spread function and some discussion of the problems associated with the determination of the point spread function of a given scanner. The questions of the calibration of the detectors in an instrument and of the intercalibration of nominally identical members of a series of instruments are also considered.","The conclusion of this paper has to be to state a warning, namely that the factors that contribute to producing the digital number DN in a computer tape or a disk ?? le of a remotely-sensed image are complicated and inter-related. This must be remembered and taken account of in any attempt at synergy in remote sensing, whether it is synergy between di??? erent sets of remotely-sensed data or synergy between remotely-sensed data and other sources of information. We conclude by mentioning a Letter that was recently published by Fisher (1997); it is called T?€he pixel: a snare and a delusion?€?. That title seems to convey the message or warning that I am trying to convey in the present paper. Fisher is trying to make the same general point that I have been trying to make, namely that in remote sensing the pixel is much more complicated than one might, at ?? rst sight, imagine. We have not resolved all the problems; the ?? rst task is to make sure that people realise that there are problems.",[]
Review of snow cover variation over the Tibetan Plateau and its influence on the broad climate system,"Variation in snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a key component of climate change and variability, and critical for many hydrological and biological processes. This review first summarizes recent observed changes of snow cover over the TP, including the relationship between the TP snow cover and that over Eurasia as a whole; recent climatology and spatial patterns; inter-annual variability and trends; as well as projected changes in snow cover. Second, we discuss the physical causes and factors contributing to variations in snow cover over the TP, including precipitation, temperature, and synoptic forcing such as the Arctic Oscillation and the westerly jet, and large scale ocean-atmosphere oscillations such as the El Ni??o?€?Southern Oscillation (ESNO), the Indian Ocean dipole, and the southern annular mode. Third, linkage between snow cover over the TP and subsequent weather and climate systems are discussed, including the East and South Asian Summer Monsoons, and their subsequent precipitation regimes. Finally, new perspectives and unresolved issues are outlined, including changes in ex- treme events and related disasters (e.g., avalanches), the use of novel datasets, the possible elevation dependency in snow cover change, expected snow cover changes under 1.5 ??C and 2 ??C global warming, the physical me- chanisms modulating climate extremes in the region, and the linkage between snow cover variation and at- mospheric pollution. Despite a large body of work over the TP, we argue that there is a need for more com- parative studies using multiple snow datasets, and snow cover information over the western TP and during summer would benefit from more attention in the future.",,"['Indian Ocean', 'Tibetan Plateau']"

Saharan dust contributions to PM10 and TSP levels in Southern and Eastern Spain,"The analysis of PM10 and TSP levels recorded in rural areas from Southern and Eastern Spain (1996}1999) shows that most of the PM10 and TSP peak events are simultaneously recorded at monitoring stations up to 1000 km apart. The study of the atmospheric dynamics by back-trajectory analysis and simulations with the SKIRONForecast System show that these high PM10 and TSP events occur when high-dust Saharan air masses are transported over the Iberian Peninsula. In the January}June period, this dust transport is mainly caused by cyclonic activity over theWest or South of Portugal, whereas in the summer period this is induced by anticyclonic activity over the East or Southeast Iberian Peninsula. Most of the Saharan intrusions which exert a major in#uence on the particulate levels occur from May to September (63%) and in January and October. In rural areas in Northeast Spain, where the PM10 annual mean is around 18???g PM10m??????, the Saharan dust accounts for 4}7 annual daily exceedances of the forthcoming PM10-EU limit value (50 ???g PM10m?????? daily mean). Higher PM10 background levels are recorded in Southern Spain (30???g PM10m?????? as annual mean for rural areas) and very similar values are recorded in industrial and urban areas. In rural areas in Southern Spain, the Saharan dust events accounts for 10}23 annual daily exceedances of the PM10 limit value, a high number when compared with the forthcoming EU standard, which states that the limit value cannot be exceeded more than 7 days per year. The proportion of Sahara-induced exceedances with respect to the total annual exceedances is discussed for rural, urban and industrial sites in Southern Spain. ??? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Saharan dust events at the Jungfraujoch detection by wavelength dependence of the single scattering albedo and first climatology analysis,"Abstract. Scattering and absorption coefficients have been measured continuously at several wavelengths since March 2001 at the high altitude site Jungfraujoch (3580 m a.s.l.). From these data, the wavelength dependences of the A??ngstro??m exponent and particularly of the single scattering albedo are determined. While the exponent of the single scattering albedo usually increases with wavelength, it de- creases with wavelength during Saharan dust events (SDE) due to the greater size of the mineral aerosol particles and their different chemical composition. This change in the sign of the single scattering exponent turns out to be a sensitive means for detecting Saharan dust events. The occurrence of SDE detected by this new method was confirmed by visual inspection of filter colors and by studying long-range back- trajectories. An examination of SDE over a 22-month period shows that SDE are more frequent during the March-June pe- riod as well as during October and November. The trajectory analysis indicated a mean traveling time of 96.5 h, with the most important source countries situated in the northern and north-western part of the Saharan desert. Most of the SDE do not lead to a detectable increase of the 48-h total suspended particulate matter (TSP) concentration at the Jungfraujoch. During Saharan dust events, the average contribution of this dust to hourly TSP at the Jungfraujoch is 16 ??g/m3, which corresponds to an annual mean of 0.8 ??g/m3 or 24% of TSP.","Saharan dust events can be detected with one-hour time res- olution by the inversion of the wavelength dependence of the single scattering albedo. The resulting negative exponent of the SSA is due to the large size of mineral aerosols, which induces a wavelength independence of the scattering coeffi- cient. Similarly a somewhat larger wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient is linked to the Saharan dust chemical composition. Clear SDE are characterized by four factors: 1) an increase of the scattering, absorption and ex- tinction coefficients, 2) vanishing scattering and A??ngstro??m exponents, 3) a larger absorption exponent and 4) a nega- tive SSA exponent. According to this study, SDE at the JFJ lasted between only a few hours and seven days. In 92% of all cases, SDE detected by this new method are corrob- orated by either filter coloration, back-trajectory analysis,",['Jungfraujoch']

Satellite remote sensing of Asian aerosols a case study of clean polluted and Asian dust storm days,"Abstract. In East Asia, satellite observation is important be- cause aerosols from natural and anthropogenic sources have been recognized as a major source of regional and global air pollution. However, retrieving aerosols properties from satellite observations over land can be difficult because of the surface reflection, complex aerosol composition, and aerosol absorption. In this study, a new aerosol retrieval method called as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec- troradiometer (MODIS) satellite aerosol retrieval (MSTAR) was developed and applied to three different aerosol event cases over East Asia. MSTAR uses a separation tech- nique that can distinguish aerosol reflectance from top-of- atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) was determined by comparing this aerosol reflectance with pre-calculated values. Three case studies show how the methodology identifies discrepancies between measured and calculated values to retrieve more accurate AOT. The comparison between MODIS and the Aerosol Robotic Net- work (AERONET) showed improvement using the suggested methodology with the cluster-based look-up-tables (LUTs) (linear slope = 0.94, R = 0.92) than using operational MODIS collection 5 aerosol products (linear slope = 0.78, R = 0.87). In conclusion, the suggested methodology is shown to work well with aerosol models acquired by statistical clustering of the observation data in East Asia.",,"['East Asia.', 'East Asia.

Seasonal and elevational variations of black carbon and dust in snow and ice in the SoluKhumbu Nepal and estimated radiative forcings,"Abstract. Black carbon (BC) and dust deposited on snow and glacier surfaces can reduce the surface albedo, acceler- ate snow and ice melt, and trigger albedo feedback. Assess- ing BC and dust concentrations in snow and ice in the Hi- malaya is of interest because this region borders large BC and dust sources, and seasonal snow and glacier ice in this region are an important source of water resources. Snow and ice samples were collected from crevasse profiles and snow pits at elevations between 5400 and 6400 m a.s.l. from Mera glacier located in the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal during spring and fall 2009, providing the first observational data of BC concentrations in snow and ice from the southern slope of the Himalaya. The samples were measured for Fe concen- trations (used as a dust proxy) via ICP-MS, total impurity content gravimetrically, and BC concentrations using a Sin- gle Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). Measured BC concentra- tions underestimate actual BC concentrations due to changes to the sample during storage and loss of BC particles in the ultrasonic nebulizer; thus, we correct for the underestimated BC mass. BC and Fe concentrations are substantially higher at elevations < 6000 m due to post-depositional processes in- cluding melt and sublimation and greater loading in the lower troposphere. Because the largest areal extent of snow and ice resides at elevations < 6000 m, the higher BC and dust concentrations at these elevations can reduce the snow and glacier albedo over large areas, accelerating melt, affecting glacier mass balance and water resources, and contributing to a positive climate forcing.

We present a sensitivity study of the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as modeled us- ing a regional atmospheric climate model, to various param- eter settings in the albedo scheme. The snow albedo scheme uses grain size as a prognostic variable and further depends on cloud cover, solar zenith angle and black carbon concen- tration. For the control experiment the overestimation of ab- sorbed shortwave radiation (+6 %) at the K-transect (west Greenland) for the period 2004?€?2009 is considerably re- duced compared to the previous density-dependent albedo scheme (+22 %). To simulate realistic snow albedo values, a small concentration of black carbon is needed, which has strongest impact on melt in the accumulation area. A back- ground ice albedo field derived from MODIS imagery im- proves the agreement between the modeled and observed SMB gradient along the K-transect. The effect of enhanced meltwater retention and refreezing is a decrease of the albedo due to an increase in snow grain size. As a secondary effect of refreezing the snowpack is heated, enhancing melt and fur- ther lowering the albedo. Especially in a warmer climate this process is important, since it reduces the refreezing potential of the firn layer that covers the Greenland Ice Sheet.",,['Greenland']

Simulations results show a large BC content in snow over the TP, espe- cially the southern slope. Because of the high aerosol content in snow and large incident solar radiation in the low latitude and high elevation, the TP exhibits the largest surface radia- tive flux changes induced by aerosols (e.g. BC, Dust) in snow compared to any other snow-covered regions in the world.",,[]

Shape and albedo from multiple images using integrability,"Previous work [5], [2] have developed an approach for estimating shape and albedo from multiple images assuming Lambertian re- flectance with single light sources. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) to show how the approach can be generalized to include am- bient background illumination, (ii) to demon- strate the use of the integrability constraint for solving this problem, and (iii) an iterative al- gorithm which is able to improve the analysis by finding shadows and rejecting them. ???

Furthermore, we have demon- strated the power of the integrability con- straint and shown that it can reduce the amount of assumptions needed to solve for shape and albedo and light source directions.

Shortwave radiative forcing and efficiency of key aerosol types using AERONET data,"Abstract. The shortwave radiative forcing (1F ) and the radiative forcing efficiency (1F eff) of natural and anthro- pogenic aerosols have been analyzed using estimates of ra- diation both at the Top (TOA) and at the Bottom Of At- mosphere (BOA) modeled based on AERONET aerosol re- trievals. Six main types of atmospheric aerosols have been compared (desert mineral dust, biomass burning, urban- industrial, continental background, oceanic and free tropo- sphere) in similar observational conditions (i.e., for solar zenith angles between 55??? and 65???) in order to compare the nearly same solar geometry. The instantaneous 1F av- erages obtained vary from ???122 ?? 37 Wm???2 (aerosol opti- cal depth, AOD, at 0.55 ??m, 0.85?? 0.45) at the BOA for the mixture of desert mineral dust and biomass burning aerosols in West Africa and ???42 ?? 22 Wm???2 (AOD = 0.9 ?? 0.5) at the TOA for the pure mineral dust also in this region up to ???6 ?? 3 Wm???2 and ???4 ?? 2 Wm???2 (AOD = 0.03 ?? 0.02) at the BOA and the TOA, respectively, for free troposphere conditions. This last result may be taken as reference on a global scale. Furthermore, we observe that the more absorb- ing aerosols are overall more efficient at the BOA in contrast to at the TOA, where they backscatter less solar energy into the space. The analysis of the radiative balance at the TOA shows that, together with the amount of aerosols and their ab- sorptive capacity, it is essential to consider the surface albedo of the region on which they are. Thus, we document that in regions with high surface reflectivity (deserts and snow con- ditions) atmospheric aerosols lead to a warming of the Earth- atmosphere system.","In recent years there has been a considerable effort to re- duce the uncertainties in the radiative effect of atmospheric aerosols. Improving our knowledge about aerosol effects is essential for understanding Earth?€?s climate. However, it is quite difficult to compare directly the obtained results on literature due to the different methodologies and data used. Thus, this work had presented valuable information allowing",['West Africa']

Shrub tundra snowmelt,"Observations of land surface and snowpack energetics and mass fluxes were made over arctic shrub tundra of varying canopy height and density using radiometers, eddy covariance flux measurements, and snow mass changes from snow surveys of depth and density. Over several years, snow accumulation in the shrubs was found to be consistently higher than in sparse tundra due to greater retention of snowfall by all shrubs and wind redistribution of snowfall to tall shrubs. Where snow accumulation was highest due to snow redistribution, shrubs often became buried by the end of winter. Three classes of shrub-snow interactions were observed: tall shrubs that were exposed over snow, tall shrubs that were bent over and buried by snow, and short shrubs buried by snow. Tall shrubs buried by snow underwent ?€?spring-up?€? during melt. Though spring-up was episodic for a single shrub, over an area it was a progressive emergence from early to mid melt of vegetation that dramatically altered the radiative and aerodynamic properties of the surface. Short shrubs were exposed more rapidly once snow depth declined below shrub height, usually near the end of melt. Net radiation increased with increasing shrub due to the decreased reflectance of shortwave radiation overwhelming the increased longwave emission from relatively warm and dark shrubs. Net radiation to snow under shrubs was much smaller than that over shrubs, but was greater than that to snow with minimal shrub exposure, in this case the difference was due to downward longwave radiation from the canopy exceeding the effect of attenuated shortwave transmission through the canopy. Because of reduced turbulent transfer under shrub canopies and minimal water vapour contributions from the bare shrub branches, sublimation fluxes declined with increasing shrub exposure. In contrast, sensible heat fluxes to the shrub surface became more negative and those to the underlying snow surface more positive with increasing shrub exposure, because of relatively warm shrub branches, particularly on clear days. From well-exposed tall shrubs, both a large upward sensible heat flow from shrub to atmosphere and a downward flow that contributed substantially to snowmelt were detected. As a result of radiative and turbulent transfer in shrub canopies, melt rates increased with shrub exposure. However, shrub exposure was not a simple function of shrub height or presence, and the transition to shrub-exposed landscape depended on initial snow depth, shrub height, shrub species and cumulative melt, and this in turn controlled the melt energetics for a particular site. As a result of these complex interactions, observations over several years showed that snowmelt rates were generally, but not always, enhanced under shrub canopies in comparison with sparsely vegetated tundra.

Simulating black carbon and dust and their radiative forcing in seasonal snow a case study over North China with field campaign measurements,"Abstract. A state-of-the-art regional model, the Weather Re- search and Forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock et al., 2008) coupled with a chemistry component (Chem) (Grell et al., 2005), is coupled with the snow, ice, and aerosol radiative (SNICAR) model that includes the most sophisticated rep- resentation of snow metamorphism processes available for climate study. The coupled model is used to simulate black carbon (BC) and dust concentrations and their radiative forc- ing in seasonal snow over North China in January?€?February of 2010, with extensive field measurements used to evaluate the model performance. In general, the model simulated spa- tial variability of BC and dust mass concentrations in the top snow layer (hereafter BCS and DSTS, respectively) are con- sistent with observations. The model generally moderately underestimates BCS in the clean regions but significantly overestimates BCS in some polluted regions. Most model re- sults fall within the uncertainty ranges of observations. The simulated BCS and DSTS are highest with > 5000 ng g???1 and up to 5 mg g???1, respectively, over the source regions and re- duce to < 50 ng g???1 and < 1 ??g g???1, respectively, in the re- mote regions. BCS and DSTS introduce a similar magnitude of radiative warming (??? 10 W m???2) in the snowpack, which is comparable to the magnitude of surface radiative cooling due to BC and dust in the atmosphere. This study represents an effort in using a regional modeling framework to simulate BC and dust and their direct radiative forcing in snowpack.","In this study, the WRF-Chem model is coupled with the SNICAR model to simulate the BC and dust concentrations and their radiative forcing in seasonal snow over North China in January?€?February of 2010, consistent with a field cam- paign region and period. This study represents the first ef- fort in evaluating WRF-Chem for simulating seasonal snow- pack and its impurities against various observations made over North China. The direct radiative forcing of BC and dust in snow is also estimated for the first time at a rela- tively high spatial resolution over North China. In general, the model captures well the observed spatial distributions of surface temperature, snow properties, and aerosol contents in snow. The difference between observed and simulated BCS may be partly because the observations at each site are as- sumed to be representative of the 36 km ?? 36 km model grid cell, which may not be true in some cases due to the inhomo- geneous spatial distribution of snow and BCS. The simulated large daily and diurnal variation of BCS cautions compari- son of model simulated mean values with observations from seasonal snow sampling at a specific time adopted in some global modeling studies (e.g., Huang et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2014).",['North China']
Simulating cold season snowpack Impacts of snow albedo and multilayer snow physics,"Abstract This study used numerical experiments to investigate two important concerns in simulating the cold season snowpack: the impact of the alterations of snow albedo due to anthropogenic aerosol deposition on snowpack and the treatment of snow physics using a multi-layer snow model. The snow albedo component considered qualitatively future changes in anthropogenic emissions and the subsequent increase or decrease of black carbon deposition on the Sierra Nevada snowpack by altering the prescribed snow albedo values. The alterations in the snow albedo primarily affect the snowpack via surface energy budget with little impact on precipitation. It was found that a decrease in snow albedo (by as little as 5?€?10% of the reference values) due to an increase in local emissions enhances snowmelt and runoff (by as much as 30?€?50%) in the early part of a cold season, resulting in reduced snowmelt-driven runoff (by as much as 30?€?50%) in the later part of the cold season, with the greatest impacts at higher elevations. An increase in snow albedo associated with reduced anthropogenic emissions results in the opposite effects. Thus, the most notable impact of the decrease in snow albedo is to enhance early-season snowmelt and to reduce late-season snowmelt, resulting in an adverse impact on warm season water resources in California. The timing of the sensitivity of snow water equivalent (SWE), snowmelt, and runoff vary systematically according to terrain elevation; as terrain elevation increases, the peak response of these fields occurs later in the cold season. The response of SWE and surface energy budget to the alterations in snow albedo found in this study shows that the effects of snow albedo on snowpack are further enhanced via local snow-albedo","Cold season snowpack plays a crucial role in determining the warm-season water supply in California and the western U.S. region.

Simulating dust accumulation,This paper describes a dust modeling technique. An empirical method is used to visually simulate the effect of dust accumulation on object surfaces. The dust amount is first predicted based on the properties of the surfaces: the surface inclination and stickiness. This predicted amount is then adjusted according to some external factors: surface exposure to wind and scraping off by other objects. The calculated dust amount is finally perturbed by a noise function on rendering to give a fuzzy visual effect.,"The use of traditional texture mapping technique[2,3] to create the appearance of dusty surfaces requires a lot of manual adjustment and is more difficult to apply to irregularly shaped objects.

Simulation of dust aerosol and its regional feedbacks over East Asia using a regional climate model,"Abstract. The ICTP regional climate model (RegCM3) cou- pled with a desert dust aerosol model is used to simulate the net radiative forcing (short-wave and long-wave) and re- lated climate effects of dust aerosols over East Asia. Two sets of experiments are completed and intercompared, one without (Exp. 1) and one with (Exp. 2) the radiative ef- fects of dust aerosols. The experiments encompass the main dust producing months, February through May, for 10 years (1997?€?2006), and the simulation results are evaluated against ground station and satellite data. The model captures the ba- sic observed climatology over the area of interest. The spatial and temporal variations of near surface concentration, mass load, optical depth and emission of dust aerosols from the main source regions are reproduced by model. The main model deficiency is an overestimate of dust amounts over the source regions and an underestimate downwind of these source areas, which indicates an underestimate of dust dis- persal. Over the desert source regions, the net TOA radiative forcing is positive, while it is small over the other regions as a result of high surface albedo values which reduce the short- wave radiative forcing. The net surface radiative fluxes are decreased by dust and this causes a surface cooling locally up to ???1???C. The inclusion of net (short-wave and long-wave) dust radiative forcing leads to a reduction of dust emission in the East Asia source regions, which is mainly caused by an increase in local stability and a corresponding decrease in dust lifting. Our results indicate that dust effects should be included in the assessment of climate change over East Asia.",,"['East Asia.', 'East Asia']"
Simulation of the last glacial cycle with a coupled climate icesheet model of intermediate complexity,"Abstract. A new version of the Earth system model of intermediate complexity, CLIMBER-2, which includes the three-dimensional polythermal ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS, is used to simulate the last glacial cycle forced by varia- tions of the Earth?€?s orbital parameters and atmospheric con- centration of major greenhouse gases. The climate and ice- sheet components of the model are coupled bi-directionally through a physically-based surface energy and mass balance interface. The model accounts for the time-dependent effect of aeolian dust on planetary and snow albedo. The model successfully simulates the temporal and spatial dynamics of the major Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets, including rapid glacial inception and strong asymmetry between the ice-sheet growth phase and glacial termination. Spatial ex- tent and elevation of the ice sheets during the last glacial maximum agree reasonably well with palaeoclimate recon- structions. A suite of sensitivity experiments demonstrates that simulated ice-sheet evolution during the last glacial cy- cle is very sensitive to some parameters of the surface energy and mass-balance interface and dust module. The possibility of a considerable acceleration of the climate ice-sheet model is discussed.",,"['Earth', 'Northern Hemisphere']"
Simulation of the microwave emission of multilayered snowpacks using the dense media radiative transfer theory The DMRTML model,"Abstract. DMRT-ML is a physically based numerical model designed to compute the thermal microwave emission of a given snowpack. Its main application is the simula- tion of brightness temperatures at frequencies in the range 1?€?200 GHz similar to those acquired routinely by space- based microwave radiometers. The model is based on the Dense Media Radiative Transfer (DMRT) theory for the computation of the snow scattering and extinction coeffi- cients and on the Discrete Ordinate Method (DISORT) to nu- merically solve the radiative transfer equation. The snowpack is modeled as a stack of multiple horizontal snow layers and an optional underlying interface representing the soil or the bottom ice. The model handles both dry and wet snow con- ditions. Such a general design allows the model to account for a wide range of snow conditions. Hitherto, the model has been used to simulate the thermal emission of the deep firn on ice sheets, shallow snowpacks overlying soil in Arc- tic and Alpine regions, and overlying ice on the large ice- sheet margins and glaciers. DMRT-ML has thus been vali- dated in three very different conditions: Antarctica, Barnes Ice Cap (Canada) and Canadian tundra. It has been recently used in conjunction with inverse methods to retrieve snow grain size from remote sensing data. The model is written in Fortran90 and available to the snow remote sensing commu- nity as an open-source software. A convenient user interface is provided in Python.","The DMRT-ML is a physically based model used to compute brightness temperature at any frequency in the microwave range and at horizontal and vertical polarizations from input variables describing multi-layered snowpack and its environ- ment.

Singlescattering albedo and radiative forcing of various aerosol species with a global threedimensional model,,"The aerosol optical thickness, A??ngstro??m exponent, and single-scattering albedo on a global scale were sim- ulated using an aerosol transport model coupled with the CCSR/NIES AGCM. Simulated aerosol optical properties for the mixture of all main tropospheric aero- sols, which are carbonaceous (OC and BC), sulfate, soil dust, and sea salt, have been compared with the ob- served optical thickness and A??ngstro??m exponent from AVHRR (Higurashi et al. 2000) and AERONET (Hol- ben et al. 1998, 2000) and with the observed single- scattering albedo from AERONET (Dubovik and King 2000) and other measurements including seasonal var- iations. They are in reasonable agreement with observed values, though the single-scattering albedo from the pre- sent model is substantially lower than that from the AERONET retrieval for desert regions. The annual global mean value of the direct radiative forcing is es- timated to be 20.32 W m22 for anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, which had been considered to be the most dominant anthropogenic aerosols. The forcing by an- thropogenic carbonaceous aerosols is, on the other hand, evaluated to be positive, 10.13 W m22. Table 8 shows hemispheric and global mean values of the aerosol op- tical thickness and the single-scattering albedo weighted by the optical thickness. The simulated single-scattering albedo is smaller over the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere and as low as 0.91 over land because of human activities. It is however 0.93 on the global scale, so that aerosol particles are calculated to cool the earth by a direct effect in the present model. In the midlatitude industrial regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the cooling effect of the aerosol direct forc- ing is simulated to largely cancel the warming effect by greenhouse gases, though the global mean value of the aerosol forcing is small in the present study.","['Southern Hemisphere', 'Northern Hemisphere']"

Size resolved dust emission fluxes measured in Niger during 3 dust storms of the AMMA experiment,"Abstract. During the 2006 and 2007 special observing peri- ods of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis cam- paign an original experimental system has been implemented in Banizoumbou (Niger) for measuring the size-resolved dust emission flux in natural conditions and documenting the pos- sible influence of wind speed on its size distribution. The instrumental set-up, associated methodology, and the quality tests applied to the data set are described before the results acquired during 2 events of the Monsoon type and 1 of the convective type are analyzed in detail. In good agreement with the theory of sandblasting, it is found in all cases that saltation must take place for a vertical emission flux to be detected. During a particular erosion event, the magnitude of the vertical flux is controlled by the surface roughness, which conditions the saltation threshold, and by the wind friction velocity. The dust flux released by the high energy convective event is also found to be much richer in very fine (<2??m) particles than those of the relatively moderate Mon- soon event, which shows that aerodynamic conditions defi- nitely influence the initial size distribution of the erosion flux as previously suggested by wind tunnel experiments. How- ever, the size distribution of the dust released by a given event is fairly constant and insensitive to even relatively important variations of u*. This is interpreted as a possible result of the rather long duration (15 min) over which wind fluctua- tions must be averaged for computing u*, which could make it an inadequate parameter for representing the very short response-time physical processes that are at the origin of fine dust emission at the measurement sites.",,"['Banizoumbou', 'Niger']"

Snow ablation energy balance in a dead forest stand,"Forest disturbance has a significant impact on hydrology due to its effect on the forest canopy, which is important for precipitation interception, transpiration, site micrometeorology, and snow accumulation and ablation. This study examines the impact of mountain pine beetle infestation and subsequent forest death on snow ablation. Dead stands experience needle loss and canopy reduction due mainly to the loss of small branches and stems, which has a subsequent impact on micrometeorological conditions. Ablation is driven largely by incoming short-wave radiation, which in dead stands is greater than in alive stands, but does not reach that available in clearcuts. Long-wave radiation emission in dead stands is lower than that in alive stands, reducing its contribution to snowpack warming and ablation. Turbulent flux contributions to snow ablation are limited in forest stands relative to clearcuts, although they are slightly greater in dead than alive stands due to the more open forest structure. Additional studies are required to refine the basic energy balance model and incorporate all processes affecting the snow ablation energy balance. Copyright ??? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,[]

Snow albedo seasonality and trend from MODIS sensor and ground data at johnsons glacier livingston island maritime antarctica,"Abstract: The aim of this work is to investigate whether snow albedo seasonality and trend under all sky conditions at Johnsons Glacier (Livingston Island, Antarctica) can be tracked using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow albedo daily product MOD10A1. The time span is from December 2006 to February 2015. As the MOD10A1 snow albedo product has never been used in Antarctica before, we also assess the performance for the MOD10A1 cloud mask. The motivation for this work is the need for a description of snow albedo under all sky conditions (including overcast days) using satellite data with mid-spatial resolution. In-situ albedo was filtered with a 5-day windowed moving average, while the MOD10A1 data were filtered using a maximum filter. Both in-situ and MOD10A1 data follow an exponential decay during the melting season, with a maximum decay of 0.049/0.094 day???1 (in-situ/MOD10A1) for the 2006?€?2007 season and a minimum of 0.016/0.016 day???1 for the 2009?€?2010 season. The duration of the decay varies from 85 days (2007?€?2008) to 167 days (2013?€?2014). Regarding the albedo trend, both data sets exhibit a slight increase of albedo, which may be explained by an increase of snowfall along with a decrease of snowmelt in the study area. Annual albedo increases of 0.2% and 0.7% are obtained for in-situ and MOD10A1 data, respectively, which amount to respective increases of 2% and 6% in the period 2006?€?2015.

Snow cover sensitivity to black carbon deposition in the Himalayas from atmospheric and ice core measurements to regional climate simulations,"Abstract. We applied a climate-chemistry global model to evaluate the impact of black carbon (BC) deposition on the Himalayan snow cover from 1998 to 2008. Using a stretched grid with a resolution of 50 km over this complex topography, the model reproduces reasonably well the remotely sensed observations of the snow cover duration. Similar to observa- tions, modelled atmospheric BC concentrations in the cen- tral Himalayas reach a minimum during the monsoon and a maximum during the post- and pre-monsoon periods. Com- paring the simulated BC concentrations in the snow with ob- servations is more challenging because of their high spatial variability and complex vertical distribution. We simulated spring BC concentrations in surface snow varying from tens to hundreds of ??g kg???1, higher by one to two orders of mag- nitude than those observed in ice cores extracted from cen- tral Himalayan glaciers at high elevations (> 6000 m a.s.l.), but typical for seasonal snow cover sampled in middle ele- vation regions (< 6000 m a.s.l.). In these areas, we estimate that both wet and dry BC depositions affect the Himalayan","We applied a coupled climate-chemistry model to evaluate the impact of BC deposition on snow cover in the HKKH from 1998 to 2008 through snow albedo variations. When compared to satellite observations, the snow cover simulated with coarse-gridded models appears particularly biased by the absence of the representation of the complex topography. Simulating atmospheric circulation and surface energy bal- ance with a finer resolution allows a more realistic represen- tation of the snow cover duration. Even with some differ- ences induced by local atmospheric processes not described by our large-scale model, this one reproduces the seasonal variations of the atmospheric BC concentrations observed in the Mount Everest region with maximum values occur- ring in the post and pre-monsoon period. Estimating the BC concentration in snow is more difficult due to the high spa- tial variability of dry and wet deposition and to the com- plex vertical distribution of BC in the snowpack. Our model simulates a BC dry deposition flux in accordance with pre- vious local analysis. However, we purport that wet deposi- tion also brings large amounts of BC to the Himalayan snow. This wet deposition does not increase directly the concen- tration of BC in the snow, in particular during the mon- soon, because snowfall also brings fresh snow at the sur- face that is cleaner than the old surface layer, highly con- centrated in BC. However, it plays a significant role in re- ducing the snow albedo: when periods of sunny days occur after snowfall events, melting and sublimation dramatically concentrate BC at the surface. Such events likely occur in spring during the progressive onset of the monsoon (M??lg et al., 2012) and occasionally in summer. Then, the atmosphere is quickly cleaned by higher rates of wet deposition causing significant levels of BC in the snow. More observations are needed to estimate the actual rates of BC wet deposition in this region. In addition, field campaigns dedicated to observe both the BC altitudinal gradients and the BC vertical profile","['Himalayas', 'Mount Everest']"

Snow densification during rain,"Abstract: Observations and measurements indicate rain often has a major impact on snow slope stability. Measurements to investigate the effects of wetting of low density, alpine snow were made at Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, U.S.A. Results indicate that on first wetting the densification rate can increase by three orders of magnitude. This initial burst of densification occurs independently of the gravitational load and is probably a result of rapid structural. changes and grain rearrangement that occurs when liquid water is first introduced. The rate decreases rapidly with time, although it remains about two orders of magnitude higher than that for dry snow of the same density. The rate of densification decreases as density increases. We assume snow behaves as a linear viscous fluid and that the metamorphic and gravitational components of compaction are additive. A simple model of compaction is derived empirically using the measurements. :The model fits the measurements very ~ell, although more experiments are needed to determine the dependence of the model parameters on liquid water content.","?€? as with dry snow, the rate of densification de- creases as density increases.","['Pass, Washington, U.S.A.', 'Washington, U.S.A.', 'Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, U.S.A.']"

Snow Impurities in the Central Pyrenees From Their Geochemical and Mineralogical Composition towards Their Impacts on Snow Albedo,"Abstract: The aim of this work is to understand aerosol transfers to the snowpack in the Spanish Pyrenees (Southern Europe) by determining their episodic mass-loading and composition, and to retrieve their regional impacts regarding optical properties and modification of snow melting. Regular aerosol monitoring has been performed during three consecutive years. Complementarily, short campaigns have been carried out to collect dust-rich snow samples. Atmospheric samples have been chemically characterized in terms of elemental composition and, in some cases, regarding their mineralogy. Snow albedo has been determined in different seasons along the campaign, and temporal variations of snow-depth from different observatories have been related to concentration of impurities in the snow surface. Our results noticed that aerosol flux in the Central Pyrenees during cold seasons (from November to May, up to 12?€?13 g m???2 of insoluble particles overall accumulated) is much higher than the observed during the warm period (from June to October, typically around 2.1?€?3.3 g m???2). Such high values observed during cold seasons were driven by the impact of severe African dust episodes. In absence of such extreme episodes, aerosol loadings in cold and warm season appeared comparable. Our study reveals that mineral dust particles from North Africa are a major driver of the aerosol loading in the snowpack in the southern side of the Central Pyrenees. Field data revealed that the heterogeneous spatial distribution of impurities on the snow surface led to differences close to 0.2 on the measured snow albedo within very short distances. Such impacts have clear implications for modelling distributed energy balance of snow and predicting snow melting from mountain headwaters.","Aerosol deposition in the Central Pyrenees (Spain) is enhanced during cold seasons when extreme desert dust episodes take place. This occurred in two out of the three winter seasons studied. Such dust inputs were recorded from November to April, and insoluble aerosol loadings associated to each event varied from 4.5 to 10.6 g m???2.","['Central Pyrenees', 'North Africa']"

Snow physics as relevant to snow photochemistry,"Abstract. Snow on the ground is a complex multiphase pho- tochemical reactor that dramatically modifies the chemical composition of the overlying atmosphere. A quantitative de- scription of the emissions of reactive gases by snow requires knowledge of snow physical properties. This overview de- tails our current understanding of how those physical proper- ties relevant to snow photochemistry vary during snow meta- morphism. Properties discussed are density, specific surface area, thermal conductivity, permeability, gas diffusivity and optical properties. Inasmuch as possible, equations to pa- rameterize these properties as functions of climatic variables are proposed, based on field measurements, laboratory ex- periments and theory. The potential of remote sensing meth- ods to obtain information on some snow physical variables such as grain size, liquid water content and snow depth are discussed. The possibilities for and difficulties of build- ing a snow photochemistry model by adapting current snow physics models are explored. Elaborate snow physics models already exist, and including variables of particular interest to snow photochemistry such as light fluxes and specific surface area appears possible. On the other hand, understanding the nature and location of reactive molecules in snow seems to be the greatest difficulty modelers will have to face for lack of experimental data, and progress on this aspect will require the detailed study of natural snow samples.","This overview shows that snow is a complex multiphase medium whose physical properties change over time. Even though the physics governing these changes is not fully un- derstood, many experimental studies have produced empiri- cal relationships that have allowed the construction of snow physics models that reproduce in a satisfactory manner ob- servations of snow evolution. Several complications arise if snow photochemistry is to be described by snow models.",[]

Snow surface albedo estimation using terrestrial photography,"A flexible and inexpensive remote sensing tool for albedo estimation using conventional ter- restrial photography and its validation on an Alpine glacier is described. The proposed technique consists in georeferencing oblique photographs to a digital elevation model (DEM), defining a map- ping function between the information contained on a given pixel of the image and the corresponding cell of the DEM. This is attained by performing a perspective projection of the DEM after a viewing transformation into the camera coordinate system. Once the image is georeferenced, the reflectance values recorded by the film or digital camera are corrected for topographic and atmospheric influ- ences and for the effect of the photographic process (lens-film-developing-scanning). Atmospheric transmittance is evaluated using the MODTRAN radiative transfer model. Diffuse and direct irradia- tion are estimated using a parametric solar irradiation model. The solar-ground geometry, anisotropy of reflected radiation, the effect of surrounding topography and the portion of visible sky are eval- uated using terrain algorithms applied to the digital elevation model. The response of the camera- film-scanner system is evaluated using an empirical approach. The result is a geographically correct map of normalised reflectance values. By comparing these to a surface of known albedo, the spa- tial distribution of albedos is calculated. Comparisons to in situ measurements on the Mer de Glace glacier, French Alps, show good agreement. Sources of error are identified and ways of improvement addressed.","points. Uncertainties in the exact geolocation of the photo-pixels, together with ambiguous assignation of image pixels to DEM cells, specially for low resolution DEMs, may lead to errors due to high albedo variability over the glacier. As figure 15 shows, inter?€?pixel variability of albedo values is in the same range as the maximum error in the albedo estimation. This variability is maximum in areas partially covered with debris and on patchy surfaces, with intermixing of snow and glacier ice. The date of DEM production is important too, given the fast retreat and thinning rate of some Alpine glaciers.",[]
Snow water equivalent of dry snow measured by differential interferometry,"Abstract?€?Large scale mapping of snow water equivalent (SWE) is a long-lasting request in many scientific and economi- cal fields. Active and passive microwave remote sensing methods are explored, as local methods cannot be generalized due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the snow pack. Microwaves interact with snow by absorption, scattering, and refraction. For dry snow of a few meters depth and frequencies below 20 GHz, absorption and scattering in the snow volume are negligible compared with the backscattered energy from the underlying ground. The sig- nal delay caused by refraction can be measured with differential radar interferometry, but phase wrapping errors and temporal decorrelation must be considered. We demonstrate that large ??SWE can be accurately determined from dense time series of differential interferograms at X- and Ku-band by temporal inte- gration. Lost phase cycles are reconstructed with a two-frequency approach. Temporal decorrelation is minimized by a temporal resolution of 4 h. A linear function between ??SWE and phase difference is derived, which deviates only a few percent from the exact solution and which depends negligibly on snow den- sity and stratigraphy. ??SWE retrieved from observations of the SnowScat instrument (SSI) were validated against observed SWE from different reference instruments, installed at a test site near the town of Sodankyl??, Finland. An accuracy below ??6 mm SWE was achieved at frequencies of 10 and 16 GHz for up to 200 mm of ??SWE. An exceptionally high temporal coherence was observed for up to 30 days for dry snow, whereas for wet snow it decayed within hours.",,[]

Snowmelt runoff modelling in an arid mountain watershed Tarim Basin China,"The feasibility of simulating daily snowmelt runoff in an arid mountain watershed with limited hydro-meteorological measurements was explored with an enhanced temperature-index snowmelt runoff model (SRM) in which the degree-day factor (DDF) is varied on the basis of shortwave solar radiation and snow albedo. The model satisfactorily simulated snowmelt runoff with a model efficiency of 0??64 for the calibration year and efficiency values of 0??78 and 0??51 for two validation years. Analysis indicated that the model was sensitive to lapse rate and snow albedo parameterization. The distinct seasonal variation of lapse rate played a key role for successful simulation. Snow albedo parameterization, which directly scaled snow cover percentage into snow albedo, worked quite well for the watershed although further validation is needed. Eight-day snow cover data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to feed the model. A frequency filter, which filtered out the clouds and large fluctuation of snow cover from the MODIS snow cover data, also improved model performance. The model, however, did not simulate peak stream flows well as most of the model runs underestimated them. Copyright ??? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"['Basin China', 'Tarim Basin China']"

Snowsourced bromine and its implications for polar tropospheric ozone,"In the last two decades, significant depletion of boundary layer ozone (ozone deple- tion events, ODEs) has been observed in both Arctic and Antarctic spring. ODEs are attributed to catalytic destruction by bromine radicals (Br plus BrO), especially during bromine explosion events (BEs), when high concentrations of BrO periodically occur.5 However, neither the exact source of bromine nor the mechanism for sustaining the observed high BrO concentrations is completely understood. Here, by considering the production of sea salt aerosol from snow lying on sea ice during blowing snow events and the subsequent release of bromine, we successfully simulate the BEs using a global chemistry transport model. We find that heterogeneous reactions play an im-10 portant role in sustaining a high fraction of the total inorganic bromine as BrO. Modeled tropospheric BrO columns generally compare well with the tropospheric BrO columns retrieved from the GOME satellite instrument (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment). The additional blowing snow bromine source, identified here, reduces modeled high latitude lower tropospheric ozone amounts by up to an average 8% in polar spring.15",,"['Arctic', 'Antarctic']"

Solar irradiance in the heterogeneous albedo environment of the Arctic coast measurements and a 3D model study,"Abstract. We present a unique case study of the solar global irradiance in a highly heterogeneous albedo environment at the Arctic coast. Diodearray spectroradiometers were de- ployed at three sites around Ny ??lesund, Svalbard, and spec- tral irradiances were simultaneously measured under clear- sky conditions during a 24 h period. The 3-D radiative trans- fer model MYSTIC is applied to simulate the measurements in various model scenarios. First, we model the effective albedos of ocean and snow and consequently around each measurement site. The effective albedos at 340 nm increase from 0.57 to 0.75, from the coastal site in the west towards the site 20 km east, away from the coast. The observed ratios of the global irradiance indicate a 15 % higher average ir- radiance, at 340 nm east relative to west, due to the higher albedo. The comparison of our model scenarios suggest a snow albedo of > 0.9 and confirm the observation that drift ice has moved into the Fjord during the day. The local time shift between the locations causes a hysteresis-like behavior of these east?€?west ratios with solar zenith angle (SZA). The observed hysteresis, however, is larger and, at 340 nm, can be explained by the drift ice. At 500 nm, a plausible explanation is a detector tilt of about 1???. The ratios between afternoon and morning irradiances at the same SZA are investigated, which confirm the above conclusions. At the coastal site, the mea- sured irradiance is significantly higher in the afternoon than in the morning. Besides the effect of changing drift ice and detector tilt, the small variations of the aerosol optical depth have to be considered also at the other stations to reduce the","3-D radiative transfer model simulations and measurements of the global irradiance at three locations are compared for a full clear-sky day at the Arctic coast of Svalbard. The ef- fective albedos for snow and water are modeled and show a strong dependence on wavelength and SZA. At 500 nm, the effective albedo increases with SZA, in particular for water, which is the so-called sun glint. The sun glint causes a strong diurnal cycle of the effective albedo at long wavelengths. The albedo has the biggest impact at short wavelengths and the effective albedos at 340 nm increase from west to east, from 0.57 to 0.75, constant within 0.02 over the day.","['Fjord', 'Arctic', 'Arctic coast']"

Solitary wave solutions of twodimensional nonlinear KadomtsevPetviashvili dynamic equation in dustacoustic plasmas,"Abstract. Nonlinear two-dimensional Kadomtsev?€?Petviashvili (KP) equation governs the behaviour of nonlinear waves in dusty plasmas with variable dust charge and two temperature ions. By using the reductive perturbation method, the two-dimensional dust-acoustic solitary waves (DASWs) in unmagnetized cold plasma consisting of dust fluid, ions and electrons lead to a KP equation. We derived the solitary travelling wave solutions of the two- dimensional nonlinear KP equation by implementing sech?€?tanh, sinh?€?cosh, extended direct algebraic and fraction direct algebraic methods. We found the electrostatic field potential and electric field in the form travelling wave solu- tions for two-dimensional nonlinear KP equation. The solutions for the KP equation obtained by using these methods can be demonstrated precisely and efficiency. As an illustration, we used the readymade package of Mathematica program 10.1 to solve the original problem. These solutions are in good agreement with the analytical one.","An unmagnetized collisionless electron?€?ion plasma is considered, featuring a superthermal (non-Maxwellian) electron distribution, which is modelled by a (kappa) distribution function. In plasmas with higher pro- portions of superthermal electrons (that is, plasmas with a lower K value), the nonlinearity and width are affected, producing solitons with decreased amplitude and width with more localized electric fields. Propaga- tion of nonlinear waves in dusty plasmas with variable dust charge and two-temperature ions is analysed. We discussed the problem formulations of two-dimensional DASWs in unmagnetized cold plasma. The nonlin- ear two-dimensional KP equation is derived by using the reductive perturbation theory.

Solving Richards Equation for snow improves snowpack meltwater runoff estimations in detailed multilayer snowpack model,"Abstract. The runoff from a snow cover during spring snowmelt or rain-on-snow events is an important factor in the hydrological cycle. In this study, three water balance schemes for the 1 dimensional physically-based snowpack model SNOWPACK are compared to lysimeter measure- ments at two alpine sites with a seasonal snow cover, but with different climatological conditions: Weissfluhjoch (WFJ) and Col de Porte (CDP). The studied period consists of 14 and 17 yr, respectively. The schemes include a simple bucket- type approach, an approximation of Richards Equation (RE), and the full RE. The results show that daily sums of snow- pack runoff are strongly related to a positive energy balance of the snow cover and therefore, all water balance schemes show very similar performance in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe ef- ficiency (NSE) coefficients (around 0.63 and 0.72 for WFJ and CDP, respectively) and r2 values (around 0.83 and 0.72 for WFJ and CDP, respectively). An analysis of the runoff dynamics over the season showed that the bucket-type and approximated RE scheme release meltwater slower than in the measurements, whereas RE provides a better agreement. Overall, solving RE for the snow cover yields the best agree- ment between modelled and measured snowpack runoff, but differences between the schemes are small. On sub-daily time scales, the water balance schemes behave very differ- ently. In that case, solving RE provides the highest agreement between modelled and measured snowpack runoff in terms of NSE coefficient (around 0.48 at both sites). At WFJ, the other water balance schemes loose most predictive power, whereas at CDP, the bucket-type scheme has an NSE coeffi- cient of 0.39. The shallower and less stratified snowpack at CDP likely reduces the differences between the water bal-","A comparison of measured snowpack runoff by a lysimeter and 3 water balance schemes for the physically-based snow- pack model SNOWPACK has shown that simulating water flow through a snow cover using RE achieves the best agree- ment with an acceptable increase in computation effort.

Soot Photometer and Integrating SphereIntegrating Sandwich Spectrophotometer measurement techniques for quantifying black carbon concentration in snow,"Abstract. We evaluate the performance of the Sin- gle Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and the Integrating Sphere/Integrating Sandwich Spectrophotometer (ISSW) in quantifying the concentration of refractory black carbon (BC) in snow samples. We find that the SP2 can be used to measure BC mass concentration in snow with substan- tially larger uncertainty (60 %) than for atmospheric sam- pling (<30 %). Achieving this level of accuracy requires careful assessment of nebulizer performance and SP2 cali- bration with consideration of the fact that BC in snow can ex- ist in larger sizes than typically observed in the atmosphere. Once these issues are addressed, the SP2 is able to mea- sure the size distribution and mass concentration of BC in the snow. Laboratory comparison of the SP2 and the ISSW revealed significant biases in the estimate of BC concentra- tion from the ISSW when test samples contained dust or non- absorbing particulates. These results suggest that current es- timates of BC mass concentration in snow or ice formed from fallen snow using either the SP2 or the ISSW may be associ- ated with significant underestimates of uncertainty.","We find that BC in snow can be present at larger sizes than in the typical ambient atmosphere. This has implications for de- terminations of BC mass content in snow, as well as possible implications for our understanding of the roles of BC in af- fecting snow albedo and in evincing snow history. Due in part to the potential for large sizes of BC in snow, use of the SP2 for BC-in-liquid measurements requires careful characteriza- tion of nebulization efficiency as a function of particle size, as well as, potentially, extrapolation of instrument response to very large BC masses. The inherent uncertainties associ- ated with these complications are unlikely to be amenable to substantial reduction, yet are still small enough that the SP2 technique can contribute meaningful information about BC content in liquid. We estimate that the SP2 can provide a measurement of BC in snow with 60 % systematic uncer- tainty, dominated by calibration uncertainty and limiting as- sumptions about the size distribution of BC in the snowmelt. A necessary assumption is that BC mass attached to larger particulate materials (& 2 ??m) in the snow mass, or in sizes smaller than the accumulation mode is negligible. This as- sumption is supported by the observed BC mass size distri- butions shown in the paper, and by tests indicating that BC does not tend to be associated with large amounts of non- BC material in individual particles. The SP2 can provide the size distribution of BC in snow, within the range of sizes aerosolized with reasonable efficiency, and within the cali- bration range applicable to the SP2. Due to these issues, pre- vious SP2 determinations of BC concentration in snow or ice formed from fallen snow may be associated with uncer- tainties significantly larger than estimated. We recommend careful assessment of the size dependence of the nebulization efficiency when using the SP2 to study the size distribution or mass concentration of BC in liquids.",[]

Source apportionment of submicron organic aerosols at an urban site by factor analytical modelling of aerosol mass spectra,"Abstract. Submicron ambient aerosol was characterized in summer 2005 at an urban background site in Zurich, Switzer- land, during a three-week measurement campaign. Highly time-resolved samples of non-refractory aerosol components were analyzed with an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was used for the first time for aerosol mass spectra to identify the main com- ponents of the total organic aerosol and their sources. The PMF retrieved factors were compared to measured reference mass spectra and were correlated with tracer species of the aerosol and gas phase measurements from collocated instru- ments. Six factors were found to explain virtually all vari- ance in the data and could be assigned either to sources or to aerosol components such as oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). Our analysis suggests that at the measurement site only a small (<10%) fraction of organic PM1 originates from freshly emitted fossil fuel combustion. Other primary sources identified to be of similar or even higher importance are charbroiling (10?€?15%) and wood burning (???10%). The fraction of all identified primary sources is considered as pri- mary organic aerosol (POA). This interpretation is supported by calculated ratios of the modelled POA and measured pri- mary pollutants such as elemental carbon (EC), NOx, and CO, which are in good agreement to literature values. A high fraction (60?€?69%) of the measured organic aerosol mass is OOA which is interpreted mostly as secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This oxygenated organic aerosol can be sepa- rated into a highly aged fraction, OOA I, (40?€?50%) with low volatility and a mass spectrum similar to fulvic acid, and a more volatile and probably less processed fraction, OOA II (on average 20%). This is the first publication of a multiple component analysis technique to AMS organic spectral data and also the first report of the OOA II component.","PMF was successfully applied for the first time to organic aerosol mass spectra measured by an Aerodyne AMS.

Sources of carbonaceous aerosols and deposited black carbon in the Arctic in winterspring implications for radiative forcing,"Abstract. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS- Chem CTM) to interpret observations of black carbon (BC) and organic aerosol (OA) from the NASA ARCTAS aircraft campaign over the North American Arctic in April 2008, as well as longer-term records in surface air and in snow (2007?€? 2009). BC emission inventories for North America, Europe, and Asia in the model are tested by comparison with surface air observations over these source regions. Russian open fires were the dominant source of OA in the Arctic troposphere during ARCTAS but we find that BC was of prevailingly an- thropogenic (fossil fuel and biofuel) origin, particularly in surface air. This source attribution is confirmed by correla- tion of BC and OA with acetonitrile and sulfate in the model and in the observations. Asian emissions are the main anthro- pogenic source of BC in the free troposphere but European, Russian and North American sources are also important in surface air. Russian anthropogenic emissions appear to dom- inate the source of BC in Arctic surface air in winter. Model simulations for 2007?€?2009 (to account for interannual vari- ability of fires) show much higher BC snow content in the Eurasian than the North American Arctic, consistent with the limited observations.

Sources of lightabsorbing aerosol in Arctic snow and their seasonal variation,"Two data sets consisting of measurements of light absorbing aerosols (LAA) in arctic snow together with suites of other corresponding chemical constituents are presented; the first from Siberia, Greenland and near the North Pole obtained in 2008, and the second from the Canadian arctic obtained in 2009. A preliminary differentiation of the5 LAA into black carbon (BC) and non-BC LAA is done. Source attribution of the light absorbing aerosols was done using a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Four sources were found for each data set (crop and grass burning, boreal biomass burning, pollution and marine). For both data sets, the crops and grass biomass burning was the main source of both LAA species, suggesting the non-BC LAA was brown carbon.10 Depth profiles at most of the sites allowed assessment of the seasonal variation in the source strengths. The biomass burning sources dominated in the spring but pollution played a more significant (though rarely dominant) role in the fall, winter and, for Green- land, summer.

Springtime warming and reduced snow cover from carbonaceous particles,"Abstract. Boreal spring climate is uniquely susceptible to solar warming mechanisms because it has expansive snow cover and receives relatively strong insolation. Carbona- ceous particles can influence snow coverage by warming the atmosphere, reducing surface-incident solar energy (dim- ming), and reducing snow reflectance after deposition (dark- ening). We apply a range of models and observations to explore impacts of these processes on springtime climate, drawing several conclusions: 1) Nearly all atmospheric particles (those with visible-band single-scatter albedo less than 0.999), including all mixtures of black carbon (BC) and organic matter (OM), increase net solar heating of the atmosphere-snow column. 2) Darkening caused by small concentrations of particles within snow exceeds the loss of absorbed energy from concurrent dimming, thus increas- ing solar heating of snowpack as well (positive net sur- face forcing). Over global snow, we estimate 6-fold greater surface forcing from darkening than dimming, caused by BC+OM. 3) Equilibrium climate experiments suggest that fossil fuel and biofuel emissions of BC+OM induce 95% as much springtime snow cover loss over Eurasia as an- thropogenic carbon dioxide, a consequence of strong snow- albedo feedback and large BC+OM emissions from Asia. 4) Of 22 climate models contributing to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, 21 underpredict the rapid warming (0.64???C decade???1) observed over springtime Eurasia since 1979.

Static and cyclic triaxial testing of ballast and subballast,"Abstract: This paper discusses the triaxial testing of a ballast material and a subballast material, which are noncohesive, granular materials typically used for construction of a railway track substructure. Both static and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted. The cyclic triaxial tests simulated the behavior of these railway substructure materials under a large number of passing train wheels. The purpose of the static tests was to a priori identify the maximum stress level that could be applied in the cyclic tests, and to assess the strength and stiffness increase produced during the cyclic loading process. In order to accurately monitor the circumferential displacement during the static and cyclic tests, a new measuring device was developed. The experimental setup, the test procedure, and the test results are treated for the ballast and subballast materials. It is found that under cyclic loading the granular materials reveal a strong tendency to compact, even if the applied stress level is close to the static failure strength of the material. This compaction behavior generally causes a ~significant! increase of the material strength and stiffness.",,[]

Summer Sea Ice Albedo in the Arctic in CMIP5 models,"Spatial and temporal variations of summer sea ice albedo over the Arctic are analyzed using an ensemble of historical CMIP5 model simulations. The results are compared to the CLARA-SAL product that is based on long-term satellite observations. The summer sea ice albedo varies substantially among CMIP5 models and many models show large5 biases compared to the CLARA-SAL product. Single summer months show an extreme spread of ice albedo among models; July-values vary between 0.3 and 0.7 for individual models. The CMIP5 ensemble mean, however, agrees relatively well in the Central Arctic but shows too high ice albedo near the ice edges and coasts. In most models, the ice albedo is spatially too uniformly distributed. The summer to summer variations10 seem to be underestimated in many global models and almost no model is able to fully reproduce the temporal evolution of ice albedo throughout the summer. While the satellite observations indicate the lowest ice albedos during August, the models show minimum values in July and substantially higher values in August. Instead, the June values are often lower in the models than in the satellite observations. This is15 probably due to too high surface temperatures in June, leading to an early start of the melt season and too cold temperatures in August causing an earlier refreezing in the models. The summer sea ice albedo in the CMIP5 models is strongly governed by surface temperature and snow conditions, particularly during the period of melt onset in early summer and refreezing in late summer.20",,"['Arctic', 'Central Arctic']"

A power functional relationships between PM10 and visibility was found among various regions generally with a good corre- lation (r2=0.90), especially in Asian SDS source regions. In addition, three SDS occurrence centers, i.e. western China, Mongolia and northern China, were identified with the Mon- golia source contributing more dust to the downwind areas including Korea and Japan than other two sources. Gener- ally, high PM10 concentrations were observed in most areas of northern China. The highest value was obtained in the center of western China with a spring daily mean value of 876 ??gm???3, and the value in other source regions exceeds 200 ??gm???3.

Surprisingly small HONO emissions from snow surfaces at Browning Pass Antarctica,"Abstract. Measured Fluxes of nitrous acid at Browning Pass, Antarctica were very low, despite conditions that are gener- ally understood as favorable for HONO emissions, includ- ing: acidic snow surfaces, an abundance of NO???3 anions in the snow surface, and abundant UV light for NO???3 photol- ysis. Photochemical modeling suggests noon time HONO fluxes of 5?€?10 nmol m???2 h???1; the measured fluxes, however, were close to zero throughout the campaign. The location and state of NO???3 in snow is crucial to its reactivity. The anal- ysis of soluble mineral ions in snow reveals that the NO???3 ion is probably present in aged snows as NaNO3. This is peculiar to our study site, and we suggest that this may affect the pho- tochemical reactivity of NO???3 , by preventing the release of products, or providing a reactive medium for newly formed HONO. In fresh snow, the NO???3 ion is probably present as dissolved or adsorbed HNO3 and yet, no HONO emissions were observed. We speculate that HONO formation from NO???3 photolysis may involve electron transfer reactions of NO2 from photosensitized organics and that fresh snows at our site had insufficient concentrations of adequate organic compounds to favor this reaction.",We have attempted to sum up some of the possible (photo) chemical and physical reaction pathways for HONO produc- tion suggested by this study in Fig. 8.

The electronic conductivity of the LiFePO4/carbon composites is greatly improved, reaching a value of 2.46 6 1023 S cm21 at room temperature. It was found that the rate capability of the synthesized LiFePO4/carbon composite is much improved because of its small grain size and good electronic conductivity.

Temporal observations of a seasonal snowpack using upwardlooking GPR,"An increase of the spatial and temporal resolution of snowpack measurements in Alpine or Arctic regions will improve the predictability of flood and avalanche hazards and increase the spatial validity of snowpack simulation models. In the winter season 2009, we installed a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system beneath the snowpack to measure snowpack conditions above the antennas. In comparison with modulated frequency systems, GPR systems consist of a much simpler technology, are commercially available and therefore are cheaper. The radar observed the temporal alternation of the snow height over more than 2??5 months. The presented data showed that with moved antennas, it is possible to record the snow height with an uncertainty of less than 8% in comparison with the probed snow depth. Three persistent melt crusts, which formed at the snow surface and were buried by further new snow events, were used as reflecting tracers to follow the snow cover evolution and to determine the strain rates of underlaying layers between adjacent measurements. The height in two-way travel time of each layer changed over time, which is a cumulative effect of settlement and variation of wave speed in response to densification and liquid water content. The infiltration of liquid water with depth during melt processes was clearly observed during one event. All recorded reflections appeared in concordance with the physical principles (e.g. in phase structure), and one can assume that distinct density steps above a certain threshold result in reflections in the radargram. The accuracy of the used impulse radar system in determining the snow water equivalent is in good agreement with previous studies, which used continuous wave radar systems. The results of this pilot study encourage further investigations with radar measurements using the described test arrangement on a daily basis for continuous destruction-free monitoring of the snow cover. Copyright ??? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[14] The data of both methods used in this study are in very good agreement. The observed distribution of the snow cover confirms our assumption of strongly reduced accu- mulation on Adler Glacier. Our results emphasize that the distribution of accumulation is not simply a function of altitude, confirming other studies [e.g., Winstral et al., 2002]. We suppose that the spatial variability of precipita- tion as well as the redistribution of snow are mainly governing the accumulation distribution. The observed variability of the mass balance for the accumulation period (0.5 m we) is one order of magnitude higher than the error of melt calculations for the entire ablation period with energy balance models [compare Arnold et al., 1996; Obleitner and Lehning, 2004]. The results underline that major improvements in glacier mass balance modelling can be achieved by focusing on the accumulation processes. Helicopter-borne GPR is recommended as a reliable tool for time-saving and accurate mapping of the snow cover. The method allows to enhance the sparse database on accumu- lation distribution toward both spatial and temporal vari- ability, providing a sound data basis for glacier monitoring (e.g., yearly repeated measurement of winter balance), for statistical analyses (e.g., digital elevation model attributes) or for validation and calibration of physical modelling. Field measurements remain essential for mutual validation and to determine snow density.",['Alpine']
Temporally delineated sources of major chemical species in high Arctic snow,"Abstract. Long-range transport of aerosol from lower lat- itudes to the high Arctic may be a significant contributor to climate forcing in the Arctic. To identify the sources of key contaminants entering the Canadian High Arctic an in- tensive campaign of snow sampling was completed at Alert, Nunavut, from September 2014 to June 2015. Fresh snow samples collected every few days were analyzed for black carbon, major ions, and metals, and this rich data set pro- vided an opportunity for a temporally refined source ap- portionment of snow composition via positive matrix fac- torization (PMF) in conjunction with FLEXPART (FLEXi- ble PARTicle dispersion model) potential emission sensitiv- ity analysis. Seven source factors were identified: sea salt, crustal metals, black carbon, carboxylic acids, nitrate, non- crustal metals, and sulfate. The sea salt and crustal factors showed good agreement with expected composition and pri- marily northern sources. High loadings of V and Se onto Factor 2, crustal metals, was consistent with expected ele- mental ratios, implying these metals were not primarily an- thropogenic in origin. Factor 3, black carbon, was an acidic factor dominated by black carbon but with some sulfate con- tribution over the winter-haze season. The lack of K+ asso- ciated with this factor, a Eurasian source, and limited known forest fire events coincident with this factor?€?s peak suggested a predominantly anthropogenic combustion source.

The ALOMAR RayleighMieRaman lidar objectives configuration and performance,"Abstract. We report on the development and current capabilities of the ALOMAR Rayleigh/Mie/Raman lidar. This instrument is one of the core instruments of the international ALOMAR facility, located near And- enes in Norway at 69??N and 16??E. The major task of the instrument is to perform advanced studies of the Arctic middle atmosphere over altitudes between about 15 to 90 km on a climatological basis. These studies address questions about the thermal structure of the Arctic middle atmosphere, the dynamical processes acting therein, and of aerosols in the form of stratospheric background aerosol, polar stratospheric clouds, nocti- lucent clouds, and injected aerosols of volcanic or anthropogenic origin. Furthermore, the lidar is meant to work together with other remote sensing instruments, both ground- and satellite-based, and with balloon- and rocket-borne instruments performing in situ observa- tions. The instrument is basically a twin lidar, using two independent power lasers and two tiltable receiving telescopes. The power lasers are Nd:YAG lasers emit- ting at wavelengths 1064, 532, and 355 nm and produc- ing 30 pulses per second each. The power lasers are highly stabilized in both their wavelengths and the directions of their laser beams. The laser beams are emitted into the atmosphere fully coaxial with the line- of-sight of the receiving telescopes. The latter use primary mirrors of 1.8 m diameter and are tiltable within 30?? o??? zenith. Their ??elds-of-view have 180 lrad angular diameter. Spectral separation, ??ltering, and detection of the received photons are made on an optical bench which carries, among a multitude of other optical components, three double Fabry-Perot interferometers (two for 532 and one for 355 nm) and one single Fabry- Perot interferometer (for 1064 nm).

The ballast effect of lithogenic matter and its influences on the carbon fluxes in the Indian Ocean,"Abstract. Data obtained from long-term sediment trap ex- periments in the Indian Ocean in conjunction with satellite observations illustrate the influence of primary production and the ballast effect on organic carbon flux into the deep sea. They suggest that primary production is the main control on the spatial variability of organic carbon fluxes at most of our study sites in the Indian Ocean, except at sites influenced by river discharges. At these sites the spatial variability of or- ganic carbon flux is influenced by lithogenic matter content. To quantify the impact of lithogenic matter on the organic carbon flux, the densities of the main ballast minerals, their flux rates and seawater properties were used to calculate sink- ing speeds of material intercepted by sediment traps. Sinking speeds in combination with satellite-derived export produc- tion rates allowed us to compute organic carbon fluxes. Flux calculations imply that lithogenic matter ballast increases or- ganic carbon fluxes at all sampling sites in the Indian Ocean by enhancing sinking speeds and reducing the time of or- ganic matter respiration in the water column. We calculated that lithogenic matter content in aggregates and pellets en- hances organic carbon flux rates on average by 45 % and by up to 62 % at trap locations in the river-influenced re- gions of the Indian Ocean. Such a strong lithogenic matter ballast effect explains the fact that organic carbon fluxes are higher in the low-productive southern Java Sea compared to the high-productive western Arabian Sea. It also implies that land use changes and the associated enhanced transport of lithogenic matter from land into the ocean may significantly affect the CO2 uptake of the organic carbon pump in the re- ceiving ocean areas.","The evaluation of data from sediment trap time series in con- junction with satellite-derived observations suggests that at sites characterised by low lithogenic matter contents (< 25 %) primary production is the dominant control of the spatial variability of organic carbon fluxes into the deep ocean. A pronounced lithogenic matter ballast effect overrides primary production as the main influence on sinking organic carbon fluxes in ocean areas under river influence. However, the lithogenic matter ballast effect strongly enhances the amount of organic carbon reaching the deep ocean at all sampling sites in the Indian Ocean. Calculated sinking speeds and or- ganic carbon fluxes indicate that the lithogenic matter bal- last effect increased the mean sinking speeds by 52 % and the mean calculated organic carbon flux by 45 %. Due to the high lithogenic matter content the lithogenic matter bal- last effect even enhanced organic carbon fluxes by > 62 % off southern Java so that organic carbon fluxes are higher in the low-productive southern Java Sea compared to the high- productive western Arabian Sea upwelling area. This implies that land use changes affect the CO2 uptake of the organic carbon pump by increasing lithogenic matter inputs into the ocean.","['Java Sea', 'Arabian Sea', 'Indian Ocean']"

The Blue Marble Next GenerationA true color earth dataset including seasonal dynamics from MODIS,"Satellite remote sensors provide the science community with high quality datasets to better understand and monitor Earth?€?s environment and climate system. When used in education, these datasets allow visual exploration of the planet at moderately high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, na- tive data file formats and file sizes are not well suited for public distribution. To help circumvent these issues, the Blue Marble Next Generation (BMNG) is a new series of 12 monthly cloud-free, global-scale images. We created the BMNG using NASA Terra MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) science data collected in 2004. We temporally adjusted the data using a discrete Fourier technique. This correction method removed cloud disturbances, but snow reflectance remains a significant challenge. For the visualization of Antarctic land area the MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica was used. The BMNG visualizes seasonal changes of the land surface (spring greening, snowmelt, drought, etc.) as true-color images and Normalized Dif- ference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps in monthly steps at 500-m spatial resolution.

The changing radiative forcing of fires global model estimates for past present and future,"Abstract. Fires are a global phenomenon that impact cli- mate and biogeochemical cycles, and interact with the bio- sphere, atmosphere and cryosphere. These impacts occur on a range of temporal and spatial scales and are difficult to quantify globally based solely on observations. Here we as- sess the role of fires in the climate system using model es- timates of radiative forcing (RF) from global fires in pre- industrial, present day, and future time periods. Fire emis- sions of trace gases and aerosols are derived from Commu- nity Land Model simulations and then used in a series of Community Atmosphere Model simulations with represen- tative emissions from the years 1850, 2000, and 2100. Ad- ditional simulations are carried out with fire emissions from the Global Fire Emission Database for a present-day compar- ison. These results are compared against the results of sim- ulations with no fire emissions to compute the contribution from fires. We consider the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol effects (including aerosol effects on biogeochemical cycles), and land and snow surface albedo. Overall, we estimate that pre-industrial fires were responsi- ble for a RF of ???1 W m???2 with respect to a pre-industrial climate without fires.

The cold regions hydrological model a platform for basing process representation and model structure on physical evidence,"After a programme of integrated field and modelling research, hydrological processes of considerable uncertainty such as snow redistribution by wind, snow interception, sublimation, snowmelt, infiltration into frozen soils, hillslope water movement over permafrost, actual evaporation, and radiation exchange to complex surfaces have been described using physically based algorithms. The cold regions hydrological model (CRHM) platform, a flexible object-oriented modelling system was devised to incorporate these algorithms and others and to connect them for purposes of simulating the cold regions hydrological cycle over small to medium sized basins. Landscape elements in CRHM can be linked episodically in process-specific cascades via blowing snow transport, overland flow, organic layer subsurface flow, mineral interflow, groundwater flow, and streamflow. CRHM has a simple user interface but no provision for calibration; parameters and model structure are selected based on the understanding of the hydrological system; as such the model can be used both for prediction and for diagnosis of the adequacy of hydrological understanding. The model is described and demonstrated in basins from the semi-arid prairie to boreal forest, mountain and muskeg regions of Canada where traditional hydrological models have great difficulty in describing hydrological phenomena. Some success is shown in simulating various elements of the hydrological cycle without calibration; this is encouraging for predicting hydrology in ungauged basins.

The detailed snowpack scheme Crocus and its implementation in SURFEX v7 2,"Abstract. Detailed studies of snow cover processes require models that offer a fine description of the snow cover proper- ties. The detailed snowpack model Crocus is such a scheme, and has been run operationally for avalanche forecasting over the French mountains for 20 yr. It is also used for climate or hydrological studies. To extend its potential applications, Crocus has been recently integrated within the framework of the externalized surface module SURFEX. SURFEX com- putes the exchanges of energy and mass between different types of surface and the atmosphere. It includes in particu- lar the land surface scheme ISBA (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere). It allows Crocus to be run ei- ther in stand-alone mode, using a time series of forcing me- teorological data or in fully coupled mode (explicit or fully implicit numerics) with atmospheric models ranging from meso-scale models to general circulation models. This ap- proach also ensures a full coupling between the snow cover and the soil beneath. Several applications of this new simu- lation platform are presented. They range from a 1-D stand- alone simulation (Col de Porte, France) to fully-distributed simulations in complex terrain over a whole mountain range (Massif des Grandes Rousses, France), or in coupled mode such as a surface energy balance and boundary layer simula- tion over the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (Dome C).","This paper describes the new version of the snowpack scheme Crocus. It includes the main features of the previ- ous versions of Crocus in terms of dynamical layering of the snowpack and explicit representation of snow metamor- phism (Brun et al., 1989, 1992). The surface energy bal- ance and heat redistribution within the snowpack are now solved following the ISBA-Explicit Snow (ES) snowpack scheme (Boone and Etchevers, 2001). New parameteriza- tions such as the impact of wind-drift allow Crocus to be run in different environments from polar regions to alpine terrain. This version of Crocus has then been implemented within the surface module SURFEX to better represent the interactions between the snowpack and its environment. Crocus is indeed fully coupled to the ISBA land surface model and its soil component allowing for an accounting of snow-vegetation interactions in a simplistic manner and realistic soil heat flux below the snow cover.

The detection of cloudfree snowcovered areas using AATSR measurements,"Abstract. A new method to detect cloud-free snow-covered areas has been developed using the measurements by the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) on board the ENVISAT satellite in order to discriminate clear snow fields for the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness or snow properties. The algorithm uses seven AATSR chan- nels from visible (VIS) to thermal infrared (TIR) and anal- yses the spectral behaviour of each pixel in order to rec- ognize the spectral signature of snow. The algorithm in- cludes a set of relative thresholds and combines all seven channels into one flexible criterion, which allows us to fil- ter out all the pixels with spectral behaviour similar to that of snow. The algorithm does not use any kind of morpho- logical criteria and does not require the studied surface to have any special structure. The snow spectral shape crite- rion was determined by a comprehensive theoretical study, which included radiative transfer simulations for various at- mospheric conditions as well as studying existing models and measurements of optical and physical properties of snow in different spectral bands. The method has been optimized to detect cloud-free snow-covered areas, and does not produce cloud/land/ocean/snow mask. However, the algorithm can be extended and able to discriminate various kinds of surfaces.","A simple and robust cloud-screening method was developed for AOT retrieval over snow using AATSR observations. The method uses a spectrum-shape control in seven VIS, NIR and TIR AATSR channels and does not require time-sequences of data, morphological analysis of the scene or manual tun- ing to set absolute thresholds. The method was compared to MODIS cloud mask for various dates and locations and showed good correspondence with it over flat snow, snow- covered mountain peaks, snow-covered forest and snow- covered ice.

The distribution of snow black carbon observed in the Arctic and compared to the GISSPUCCINI model,"Abstract. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the latest NASA GISS composition-climate model, GISS-E2- PUCCINI, to simulate the spatial distribution of snow BC (sBC) in the Arctic relative to present-day observations. Ra- diative forcing due to BC deposition onto Arctic snow and sea ice is also estimated. Two sets of model simulations are analyzed, where meteorology is linearly relaxed towards Na- tional Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and to- wards NASA Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Ap- plications (MERRA) reanalyses. Results indicate that the modeled concentrations of sBC are comparable with present- day observations in and around the Arctic Ocean, except for apparent underestimation at a few sites in the Russian Arc- tic. That said, the model has some biases in its simulated spatial distribution of BC deposition to the Arctic. The sim- ulations from the two model runs are roughly equal, indi- cating that discrepancies between model and observations come from other sources. Underestimation of biomass burn- ing emissions in Northern Eurasia may be the main cause of the low biases in the Russian Arctic.

The effect of human activity on radiative forcing of climate change a review of recent developments,"Human activity has perturbed the Earth?€?s energy balance by altering the properties of the atmosphere and the surface.

The effect of snowsea ice type on the response of albedo and light penetration depth efolding depth to increasing black carbon,"Abstract. The optical properties of snow/sea ice vary with age and by the processes they were formed, giving charac- teristic types of snow and sea ice. The response of albedo and light penetration depth (e-folding depth) to increasing mass ratio of black carbon is shown to depend on the snow and sea ice type and the thickness of the snow or sea ice. The response of albedo and e-folding depth of three differ- ent types of snow (cold polar snow, wind-packed snow and melting snow) and three sea ice (multi-year ice, first-year ice and melting sea ice) to increasing mass ratio of black car- bon is calculated using a coupled atmosphere?€?snow/sea ice radiative-transfer model (TUV-snow), over the optical wave- lengths of 300?€?800 nm. The snow and sea ice types are ef- fectively defined by a scattering cross-section, density and asymmetry parameter. The relative change in albedo and e- folding depth of each of the three snow and three sea ice types with increasing mass ratio of black carbon is consid- ered relative to a base case of 1 ng g???1 of black carbon. The relative response of each snow and sea ice type is intercom- pared to examine how different types of snow and sea ice respond relative to each other. The relative change in albedo of a melting snowpack is a factor of four more responsive to additions of black carbon compared to cold polar snow over a black carbon increase from 1 to 50 ng g???1, while the relative change in albedo of a melting sea ice is a factor of two more responsive to additions of black carbon compared to multi- year ice for the same increase in mass ratio of black carbon. The response of e-folding depth is effectively not dependent on snow/sea ice type. The albedo of sea ice is more respon- sive to increasing mass ratios of black carbon than snow.","The response of albedo of snow/sea ice to increased mass ra- tios of black carbon is dependent on the type of snow and sea ice. A snow or sea ice with a large scattering cross-section, e.g. a cold polar snow or a multi-year sea ice is less respon- sive to black carbon than a melting snow or sea ice. The change in albedo owing to increasing black carbon is less in snow than sea ice. For an increase of black carbon from 1 to 50 ng g???1 a relative change in albedo of 76 % occurs for melting sea ice compared to 30 % for multi-year ice, 11 % for melting snow and 3 % for cold polar snow. In the case of e-folding depth the snow and sea ice type has very little affect on the relative response due to increased black carbon. Current climate change is leading to a decrease in multi-year sea ice and an increase in first-year/melting sea ice, which is more responsive to black carbon, potentially exacerbating sea ice melting rates.",[]
The effects of additional black carbon on the albedo of Arctic sea ice variation with sea ice type and snow cover,,"Absorption and scattering cross-section coefficients were calculated for a first-year and multi-year sea ice and dry and wet snow types suggesting black carbon is the dominating absorbing impurity. Estimated black carbon mass ratios for the sea ice and snow are larger than previously reported, suggesting the presence of a secondary absorbing impurity which is likely to be atmospheric dust/sediment. Radiative- transfer calculations demonstrate the albedo of sea ice is sur- prisingly unresponsive to additional black carbon additions up to 100 ngg???1 with a decrease in albedo to 99.7 % of the original value of albedo due to an addition of 8 ngg???1 black carbon in multi-year year sea ice compared to an albedo de- crease to 98.7 % for the same black carbon mass ratio in- crease in first-year sea ice. This highlights that the first-year sea ice proved more responsive to black carbon additions. The first-year sea ice is a less scattering environment than the multi-year sea ice. Thus, a less scattering sea ice environment may be more responsive to additional black carbon. As sea ice is predominately snow covered, the influence of an over- lying snow cover at mitigating the effects of black carbon in the sea ice surface layer was also investigated. A 0.5 cm layer of snow greatly diminishes the effect of black carbon in sea ice on snow surface albedo. A 2?€?5 cm layer (less than half the e-folding depth of snow) is enough to ?€?mask?€? any change in surface albedo owing to additional black carbon in the sea ice, but not thick enough to ignore the underlying sea ice. For snow on sea ice a practical definition of optically thick appears to be approximately one e-folding depth of snow. Although the effects of black carbon in sea ice are limited to when snow cover is below 2?€?5 cm, black carbon is still critical in the sea ice system because as soon as snow is thin enough for black carbon in the sea ice to affect surface albedo it will exacerbate snow melting, leading to longer snow-free conditions and greater sea ice melting. Furthermore the pe- riod of the year when sea ice is snow free coincides with the smallest solar zenith angles, i.e. when the solar radiation is greatest, so the influence of black carbon will be larger.",['Arctic sea']

The effects of layers in dry snow on its passive microwave emissions using dense media radiative transfer theory based on the quasicrystalline approximation QCA ,"Abstract?€?A model for the microwave emissions of multilayer dry snowpacks, based on dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) theory with the quasicrystalline approximation (QCA), provides more accurate results when compared to emissions determined by a homogeneous snowpack and other scattering models. The DMRT model accounts for adhesive aggregate effects, which leads to dense media Mie scattering by using a sticky particle model. With the multilayer model, we examined both the frequency and polarization dependence of brightness temperatures (Tb?€?s) from representative snowpacks and compared them to results from a single-layer model and found that the multilayer model predicts higher polarization differences, twice as much, and weaker fre- quency dependence. We also studied the temporal evolution of Tb from multilayer snowpacks. The difference between Tb?€?s at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz can be 5 K lower than the single-layer model prediction in this paper. By using the snowpack observations from the Cold Land Processes Field Experiment as input for both multi- and single-layer models, it shows that the multilayer Tb?€?s are in better agreement with the data than the single-layer model. With one set of physical parameters, the multilayer QCA/DMRT model matched all four channels of Tb observations simultaneously, whereas the single-layer model could only reproduce vertically polarized Tb?€?s. Also, the polarization difference and frequency dependence were accurately matched by the multilayer model using the same set of physical parameters. Hence, algorithms for the retrieval of snowpack depth or water equivalent should be based on multilayer scattering models to achieve greater accuracy.",,[]
The effects of snowfall on solar photovoltaic performance,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are frequently installed in climates with significant snowfall. To better understand the effects of snowfall on the performance of PV systems, a multi-angle, multi-technology PV system was commissioned and monitored over two winters. A novel methodology was introduced and validated with this system, which allows for the determination of snowfall losses from time-series performance data with correlated meteorological observations down to a 5-minute resolution. In addition, a new method for determining the probability distribution of snow deposition on a module from image data was developed. It was found that the losses due to snowfall are dependent on the angle and technology being considered and the effects of increased albedo in the surroundings of a PV system can increase expected yields, particularly in the case of high tilt angle systems. Existing methods for predicting losses due to snowfall were investigated, and were found to provide overly conservative estimates of snow losses. Overall the results show that the proper assessment of snow related losses can help improve system performance and maintenance. It is concluded that proper characterization of the snowfall effect on PV system performance can influence better systems optimization for climates experiencing snowfall.","This study introduced a methodology that can be used to derive snowfall losses and time to clear of snow from a time series of module performance data, a metric commonly collected at PV installation sites. In addition, a methodology to analyse snow shedding patterns from image data was introduced, and showed the variability of snow distribution patterns depending on module type and orientation. Overall it was seen that snowfall will tend to settle in a vertical gradient on the surface of the module.",[]

The heterogeneous reaction of hydroxyl radicals with submicron squalane particles a model system for understanding the oxidative aging of ambient aerosols,"Abstract. The heterogeneous reaction of OH radicals with sub-micron squalane particles, in the presence of O2, is used as a model system to explore the fundamental chemi- cal mechanisms that control the oxidative aging of organic aerosols in the atmosphere. Detailed kinetic measurements combined with elemental mass spectrometric analysis reveal that the reaction proceeds sequentially by adding an aver- age of one oxygenated functional group per reactive loss of squalane. The reactive uptake coefficient of OH with squalane particles is determined to be 0.3??0.07 at an average OH concentration of ???1??1010 molecules cm???3. Based on a comparison between the measured particle mass and model predictions it appears that significant volatilization of a re- duced organic particle would be extremely slow in the real atmosphere. However, as the aerosols become more oxy- genated, volatilization becomes a significant loss channel for organic material in the particle-phase. Together these re- sults provide a chemical framework in which to understand how heterogeneous chemistry transforms the physiochemi- cal properties of particle-phase organic matter in the tropo- sphere.","Using a photochemical flow reactor combined with AMS particle analysis, the kinetics and chemical mechanism for OH oxidation of squalane particles has been investigated. The reactive uptake coefficient of OH on squalane particles is 0.3??0.07, indicating that 30% of the OH-particle colli- sions result in a reaction. Based on the evolution of the oxidation products during the first few oxidation lifetimes it is found that one O atom is added per reactive loss of squalane, which is consistent with a sequential oxidation re- action mechanism. At higher oxidation lifetimes, and there- fore higher O/C ratios, the particles lose carbon leading to particle volatilization. In fact, for O/C ratios above ???0.3 it appears that volatilization dominates, which may be par- ticularly important for heterogeneous reactions with ambi- ent SOA particles. These results suggest that future studies should focus on the heterogeneous reactivity of highly oxy- genated, SOA-like, aerosols.",[]

The impact of coniferous forest temperature on incoming longwave radiation to melting snow,"Measurements were conducted in coniferous forests of differing density, insolation and latitude to test whether air temperatures are suitable surrogates for canopy temperature in estimating sub-canopy longwave irradiance to snow. Air temperature generally was a good representation of canopy radiative temperature under conditions of low insolation. However during high insolation, needle and branch temperatures were well estimated by air temperature only in relatively dense canopies and exceeded air temperatures elsewhere. Tree trunks exceeded air temperatures in all canopies during high insolation, with the relatively hottest trunks associated with direct interception of sunlight, sparse canopy cover and dead trees. The exitance of longwave radiation from these relatively warm canopies exceeded that calculated assuming canopy temperature was equal to air temperature. This enhancement was strongly related to the extinction of shortwave radiation by the canopy. Estimates of sub-canopy longwave irradiance using either two-energy source or two thermal regime approaches to evaluate the contribution of canopy longwave exitance performed better than did estimates that used only air temperature and sky view. However, there was little evidence that such corrections are necessary under cloudy or low solar insolation conditions. The longwave enhancement effect due to shortwave extinction was important to sub-canopy longwave irradiance to snow during clear, sunlit conditions. Longwave enhancement increased with increasing solar elevation angle and decreasing air temperature. Its relative importance to longwave irradiance to snow was insensitive to canopy density. As errors from ignoring enhanced longwave contributions from the canopy accumulate over the winter season, it is important for snow energy balance computations to include the enhancement in order to better calculate snow internal energy and therefore the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and sublimation.

The importance of accurate glacier albedo for estimates of surface mass balance on Vatnaj??kull evaluating the surface energy budget in a regional climate model with ,"Abstract. A simulation of the surface climate of Vatnaj??kull ice cap, Iceland, carried out with the regional climate model HIRHAM5 for the period 1980?€?2014, is used to estimate the evolution of the glacier surface mass balance (SMB). This simulation uses a new snow albedo parameterization that allows albedo to exponentially decay with time and is surface temperature dependent. The albedo scheme utilizes a new background map of the ice albedo created from ob- served MODIS data. The simulation is evaluated against ob- served daily values of weather parameters from five auto- matic weather stations (AWSs) from the period 2001?€?2014, as well as in situ SMB measurements from the period 1995?€? 2014. The model agrees well with observations at the AWS sites, albeit with a general underestimation of the net radia- tion. This is due to an underestimation of the incoming radia- tion and a general overestimation of the albedo. The average modelled albedo is overestimated in the ablation zone, which we attribute to an overestimation of the thickness of the snow layer and not taking the surface darkening from dirt and vol- canic ash deposition during dust storms and volcanic erup- tions into account. A comparison with the specific summer, winter, and net mass balance for the whole of Vatnaj??kull (1995?€?2014) shows a good overall fit during the summer, with a small mass balance underestimation of 0.04 m w.e. on average, whereas the winter mass balance is overestimated by on average 0.5 m w.e. due to too large precipitation at the","The comparison of a HIRHAM5 simulation with data from five AWSs on Vatnaj??kull ice cap allows us to evaluate the model performance. By comparing observations from April to October with model output, it was found that the model simulates the surface energy balance components and surface mass balance well, albeit with general underestimations of the energy balance components. Even though the energy bal- ance was generally underestimated, the model simulated the near-surface temperature well. The reason for this is that the comparisons only use observations from the summer months, where the glacier surface is generally at the melting point, and thus the energy is used for melting and not for raising the temperature of the surface.",['Vatnaj??kull']

The influence of soil remediation on lead in house dust,"Lead in house dust has long been recognized as a principal source of excess lead absorption among children at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site (BHSS) in northern Idaho. House dust lead concentration from homeowner?€?s vacuum cleaner bags has been monitored since the epidemic of childhood lead poisoning in 1974. Geometric mean house dust lead concentrations decreased from )10 000 mgykg in 1974 to approximately 4000 mgykg in 1975, in response to air pollution control initiatives at the defective primary lead smelter. After smelter closure, 1983 mean dust lead concentrations were near 3000 mgykg and were most dependent on soil sources. Following emergency soil removals from public areas and roadsides and fugitive dust control efforts in the mid-1980s, house dust lead decreased by approximately 40?€?60% to 1200?€?1500 mgykg. In 1992, a cleanup goal of 500 mgykg dust lead community average, with no individual home exceeding 1000 mgykg, was adopted. This goal was to be achieved by a combination of contaminated soil removals and fugitive dust control efforts throughout the 21 square mile BHSS. Continual reductions in house dust lead concentrations have been noted throughout the residential area soil cleanup. Geometric mean house dust lead concentrations averaged approximately 500?€?600 mgykg from 1996 to 1999 and dropped below 500 mgykg in 2000. Analysis of these data indicates that approximately 20% of the variance in dust lead concentrations is attributed to yard, neighborhood, and community soil lead concentrations. Since 1996, dust lead concentrations and dust and lead loading rates have also been measured by dust mats placed at entryways into the homes. Neighborhood soil lead concentrations, household hygiene, the number of adults living in the home, and the number of hours a child spends outdoors in summer explain approximately 26% of the variance in mat dust lead loading rates. It is estimated that post-remedial house dust lead concentrations will stabilize at 400?€?500 mgykg, as compared to approximately 200 mgykg in socio-economically similar background communities; the difference possibly attributed","The remedial strategy adopted to reduce expo- sure, risk, and blood lead levels at the BHSS was to decrease residential soil lead concentrations to RAOs of -1000 mgykg individual home and - 350 mgykg community mean. This was to be accomplished through replacement and covering of contaminated soils with clean material. Subse- quently, these actions were anticipated to reduce house dust lead levels to the 500 mgykg commu- nity mean RAO. As the cleanup was completed in Smelterville and continues in other communities, progress toward these goals was examined in the 5-year review for the BHSS.",['Smelterville']

The magnitude of the snowsourced reactive nitrogen flux to the boundary layer in the Uintah Basin Utah USA,"Abstract.

The onset of twinning in metals a constitutive description,"Abstract?€?A constitutive approach is developed that predicts the critical stress for twinning as a function of external (temperature, strain rate) and internal (grain size, stacking-fault energy) parameters. Plastic defor- mation by slip and twinning are considered as competitive mechanisms. The twinning stress is equated to the slip stress based on the plastic flow by thermally assisted movement of dislocations over obstacles, which leads to successful prediction of the slip-twinning transition. The model is applied to body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and hexagonal metals and alloys: Fe, Cu, brasses, and Ti, respectively. A constitutive expression for the twinning stress in BCC metals is developed using dislocation emission from a source and the formation of pile-ups, as rate-controlling mechanism. Employing an Eshelby-type analysis, the critical size of twin nucleus and twinning stress are correlated to the twin-boundary energy, which is directly related to the stacking-fault energy (SFE) for FCC metals. The effects of grain size and SFE are examined and the results indicate that the grain-scale pile-ups are not the source of the stress concentrations giving rise to twinning in FCC metals. The constitutive description of the slip-twinning transition are incorporated into the Weertman?€?Ashby deformation mechanism maps, thereby enabling the introduction of a twinning domain. This is illustrated for titanium with a grain size of 100 ??m. ??? 2001 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",,[]
The operative remote sensing of snow covered area in a service of hydrological modeling in Finland,,,['Finland']
The origin of sea salt in snow on Arctic sea ice and in coastal regions,"Snow, through its trace constituents, can have a major impact on lower tropospheric chemistry, as evidenced by ozone depletion events (ODEs) in oceanic polar areas. These ODEs are caused by the chemistry of bromine compounds, that originate from sea salt bromide. According to current ideas, bromide may be supplied to the snow5 surface either by upward migration from sea ice or by frost flowers being wind-blown to the snow surface. We investigate here the relative importance of both these pro- cesses by analyzing mineral ions in snow samples collected near Alert and Ny-A??lesund (Canadian and European high Arctic) in winter and spring. Vertical ionic profiles in the snowpack on sea ice are measured to test upward migration of sea salt ions and to10 seek evidence for ion fractionation processes. Time series of the ionic composition of surface snow layers are investigated to quantify wind-transported ions. Upward mi- gration of unfractionated sea salt, to heights of at least 17 cm, was observed in snow sampled in winter, at temperatures near ???30???C, leading to Cl??? concentration of several hundred ??M. Upward migration thus has the potential to supply ions to surface snow15 layers. Time series show that wind can deposit aerosols to the top few cm of the snow, leading also to Cl??? concentrations of several hundred ??M, so that both migration from sea ice and wind transport can significantly contribute ions to snow. At Ny-A??lesund, sea salt transported by wind was unfractionated, implying that it does not come from frost flowers. In the Arctic, frost flowers thus do not appear necessary to lead to large20 sea salt concentrations in surface snow, and to supply the bromide needed for ODEs. The data obtained also indicate that ODEs lead to significant deposition of Br??? to snow. We speculate that this can also take place in coastal regions and contribute to propa- gate ODEs inland. Finally, we stress the need to measure snow physical parameters such as permeability and specific surface area, to understand quantitatively changes25 in snow chemistry.",,"['sea ice', 'Alert', 'Arctic sea ice']"
The origin of transparent exopolymer particles TEP and their role in the sedimentation of particulate matter,"Seasonal changes in the concentration of suspended transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and flux rates of TEP and other particles at 500m were measured at 2-week intervals at a station in the Santa Barbara Channel between May 1995 and June 1997 in order to investigate the hypothesis that the presence of TEP is necessary for the aggregation and subsequent sedimentation of particles from the pelagic zone. During the 2-year period phytoplankton appeared to be the most significant source of TEP. However, in association with phytoplankton, the concentration of TEP was also positively affected by bacteria abundance. Possibly bacteria enhance the production of TEP by phytoplankton. The presence of TEP was necessary for the sedimentation of diatoms. However, only 67% of the peaks in particulate organic carbon flux corresponded to peaks in TEP flux. Lithogenic silica sedimented only when scavenged by marine snow; either by TEP-rich diatom aggregates or by zooplankton-derived snow (larvacean houses). TEP were not involved in the sedimentation of foraminifera. Although sedimentation was the dominant loss processes of TEP out of the euphotic zone, other loss process must have been important at greater depth, as only a small fraction of the standing stock of TEP arrived at 500m. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Planet Simulator Towards a user friendly model,"Abstract The Planet Simulator is a Model of Intermediate Complexity (MIC) which can be used to run climate and paleo-climate simulations for time scales up to 10 thousand years or more in an acceptable real time. The pri- orities in development are set to speed, easy handling and portability. Its modular structure allows a problem dependent configuration. Adaptions exist for the atmospheres of Mars and of Saturn?€?s moon Titan. Common coupling interfaces enable the addition of ocean models, ice models, vegetation and more. An interactive mode with a Model Starter (MoSt) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be used to select a model con- figuration from the available hierarchy, set its parameters and inspect atmospheric fields while changing model parameters on the fly. This is especially useful for teaching, debugging and tuning of parameterizations. This paper gives an overview of the model?€?s features. The complete model including sources and documentation is available at (www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/plasim).",,[]

The remote sensing of radiative forcing by lightabsorbing particles LAPs in seasonal snow over northeastern China,"Abstract. Light-absorbing particles (LAPs) deposited on snow can decrease snow albedo and affect climate through snow-albedo radiative forcing. In this study, we use MODIS observations combined with a snow-albedo model (SNICAR ?€? Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative) and a radiative trans- fer model (SBDART ?€? Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) to retrieve the instantaneous spectrally integrated radiative forcing at the surface by LAPs in snow (RFLAPsMODIS) under clear-sky conditions at the time of MODIS Aqua overpass across northeastern China (NEC) in January?€? February from 2003 to 2017. RFLAPsMODIS presents distinct spa- tial variability, with the minimum (22.3 W m???2) in western NEC and the maximum (64.6 W m???2) near industrial areas in central NEC. The regional mean RFLAPsMODIS is ??? 45.1?? 6.8 W m???2 in NEC. The positive (negative) uncertainties of retrieved RFLAPsMODIS due to atmospheric correction range from 14 % to 57 % (???14 % to ???47 %), and the uncertainty value basically decreases with the increased RFLAPsMODIS. We attribute the variations of radiative forcing based on remote sensing and find that the spatial variance of RFLAPsMODIS in NEC is 74.6 % due to LAPs and 21.2 % and 4.2 % due to snow grain size and solar zenith angle. Furthermore, based on multiple linear regression, the BC dry and wet deposition and snow- fall could explain 84 % of the spatial variance of LAP con- tents, which confirms the reasonability of the spatial patterns of retrieved RFLAPsMODIS in NEC. We validate RF","In this study, we retrieve ILAPs, Reff, and RFLAPsMODIS across NEC in January?€?February from 2003 to 2017 using MODIS data, together with a snow-albedo model (SNICAR) and a radiative transfer model (SBDART). On average, ILAPs is ??? 0.27??0.045,Reff is??? 261??32 ??m, and RFLAPsMODIS is??? 45.1?? 6.8 W m???2 in NEC. The distribution of RFLAPsMODIS presents distinct spatial differences; the lowest value is 22.3 W m???2, which occurs in remote western NEC, and the highest value is 64.6 W m???2, which occurs near the industrial areas in cen- tral NEC. Both ILAPs and RFLAPsMODIS show larger uncertainties from atmospheric correction, as their values are smaller. We make a first attempt to attribute the variations of radiative forcing based on remote sensing. The results point out that ILAPs, Reff, and ?? make fractional contributions of 74.6 %, 21.2 %, and 4.2 % to the spatial variance of RFLAPsMODIS in our study areas across NEC. The result confirms that the LAP content in snow plays a dominant role in determining the spatial distribution of RFLAPsMODIS.

The SURFEXv7 2 land and ocean surface platform for coupled or offline simulation of earth surface variables and fluxes,"Abstract. SURFEX is a new externalized land and ocean sur- face platform that describes the surface fluxes and the evo- lution of four types of surfaces: nature, town, inland water and ocean. It is mostly based on pre-existing, well-validated scientific models that are continuously improved. The moti- vation for the building of SURFEX is to use strictly identi- cal scientific models in a high range of applications in order to mutualise the research and development efforts. SURFEX can be run in offline mode (0-D or 2-D runs) or in coupled mode (from mesoscale models to numerical weather predic- tion and climate models). An assimilation mode is included for numerical weather prediction and monitoring. In addition to momentum, heat and water fluxes, SURFEX is able to sim- ulate fluxes of carbon dioxide, chemical species, continental aerosols, sea salt and snow particles. The main principles of the organisation of the surface are described first. Then, a survey is made of the scientific module (including the cou- pling strategy). Finally, the main applications of the code are summarised.

Three examples where the specific surface area of snow increased over time,"Abstract. Snow on the ground impacts climate through its high albedo and affects atmospheric composition through its ability to adsorb chemical compounds. The quantification of these effects requires the knowledge of the specific surface area (SSA) of snow and its rate of change. All relevant stud- ies indicate that snow SSA decreases over time. Here, we report for the first time three cases where the SSA of snow increased over time. These are (1) the transformation of a melt-freeze crust into depth hoar, producing an increase in SSA from 3.4 to 8.8 m2 kg???1. (2) The mobilization of sur- face snow by wind, which reduced the size of snow crys- tals by sublimation and fragmented them. This formed a surface snow layer with a SSA of 61 m2 kg???1 from layers whose SSAs were originally 42 and 50 m2 kg???1. (3) The sieving of blowing snow by a snow layer, which allowed the smallest crystals to penetrate into open spaces in the snow, leading to an SSA increase from 32 to 61 m2 kg???1. We dis- cuss that other mechanisms for SSA increase are possible. Overall, SSA increases are probably not rare. They lead to enhanced uptake of chemical compounds and to increases in snow albedo, and their inclusion in relevant chemical and cli- mate models deserves consideration.",,[]
Tibetan plateau geladaindong black carbon ice core record 18431982 recent increases due to higher emissions and lower snow accumulation,"Received 8 January 2016; revised 18 July 2016; accepted 21 July 2016 Abstract Black carbon (BC) deposited on snow and glacier surfaces can reduce albedo and lead to accelerated melt. An ice core recovered from Guoqu glacier on Mt. Geladaindong and analyzed using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) provides the first long-term (1843e1982) record of BC from the central Tibetan Plateau. Post 1940 the record is characterized by an increased occurrence of years with above average BC, and the highest BC values of the record. The BC increase in recent decades is likely caused by a combination of increased emissions from regional BC sources, and a reduction in snow accumulation. Guoqu glacier has received no net ice accumulation since the 1980s, and is a potential example of a glacier where an increase in the equilibrium line altitude is exposing buried high impurity layers. That BC concentrations in the uppermost layers of the Geladaindong ice core are not substantially higher relative to deeper in the ice core suggests that some of the BC that must have been deposited on Guoqu glacier via wet or dry deposition between 1983 and 2005 has been removed from the surface of the glacier, potentially via supraglacial or englacial meltwater.",,"['Geladaindong', 'Mt.

Timespace continuity of daily maps of fractional snow cover and albedo from MODIS,,"Fig. 11 shows why a smoothed and interpolated estimate of snow-covered area is a more useful product. The graph shows the seasonal progression of total snow-covered area in the Tuolu- mne?€?Merced grid shown in previous figures. The smooth curve is our best estimate of the snow-covered area, by date. Also shown is the daily snow cover filtered for clouds and noise, but not inter- polated between measurements or corrected for artifacts intro- duced by off-nadir views. In Fig. 10, the lower values of rS(t) for snow-covered area correspond to times when cloud cover was extensive and persistent. The lower values of rA(t) point out the need to further examine albedo evolution and also the perfor- mance of the MODSCAG algorithm near the snowline. Where the fractional snow cover becomes small (less than 10?€?20% of the pix- el) the spectral signature of the snow is overwhelmed by the other surface covers, so the reliability of the fraction estimated is reduced. 7.

Tools for atmospheric radiative transfer Streamer and FluxNet,"Abstract??Two tools for the solution of radiative transfer problems are presented. Streamer is a ??exible medium spectral resolution radiative transfer model based on the plane-parallel theory of radiative transfer. Capable of computing either ??uxes or radiances, it is suitable for studying radiative processes at the surface or within the atmosphere and for the development of remote-sensing algorithms. FluxNet is a fast neural network-based implementation of Streamer for computing surface ??uxes. It allows for a sophisticated treatment of radiative processes in the analysis of large data sets and potential integration into geophysical models where computational e???ciency is an issue. Documentation and tools for the development of alternative versions of FluxNet are available. Collectively, Streamer and FluxNet solve a wide variety of problems related to radiative transfer: Streamer provides the detail and sophistication needed to perform basic research on most aspects of complex radiative processes, whereas the e???ciency and simplicity of FluxNet make it ideal for operational use. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Transport of desert dust mixed with North African industrial pollutants in the subtropical Saharan Air Layer,"Abstract. An analysis of chemical composition data of par- ticulate matter samples (TSP, PM10 and PM2.5) collected from 2002 to 2008 in the North Atlantic free troposphere at the Izan??a Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) observatory (Tenerife, Canary Islands) shows that desert dust is very fre- quently mixed with particulate pollutants in the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). The study of this data set with Median Concen- trations At Receptor (MCAR) plots allowed the identifica- tion of the potential source regions of the dust and particulate pollutants. Areas located at the south of the southern slope of the Atlas mountains emerge as the most frequent source of the soil desert dust advected to the northern edge of the SAL in summer. Industrial emissions occurring in Northern Algeria, Eastern Algeria, Tunisia and the Atlantic coast of Morocco appear as the most important source of the nitrate, ammonium and a fraction of sulphate (at least 60 % of the sulphate <10 ??m transported from some regions) observed in the SAL. These emissions are mostly linked to crude oil refineries, phosphate-based fertilizer industry and power plants. Although desert dust emissions appear as the most frequent source of the phosphorous observed in the SAL, high P concentrations are observed when the SAL is affected by emissions from open mines of phosphate and phosphate based fertilizer industry. The results also show that a signifi- cant fraction of the sulphate (up to 90 % of sulphate <10 ??m transported from some regions) observed in the SAL may be influenced by soil emissions of evaporite minerals in well defined regions where dry saline lakes (chotts) are present. These interpretations of the MCAR plots are consistent with the results obtained with the Positive Matrix Factorization",,"['Morocco', 'Atlantic', 'Tunisia', 'North Atlantic']"
Trophic basis of invertebrate production in 2 streams at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest,"Abstract. Many forest stream food webs have leaf litter as the primary food resource, but instream primary production can also be quantitatively important, in part because it is more easily assimilated. We estimated the trophic basis of invertebrate production in 2 streams at Hubbard Brook Experi- mental Forest: Bear Brook (BB), a 2nd-order closed canopy stream, and Main Hubbard Brook (HB), a 5th-order open-canopy stream. We combined secondary production measurements for 1 y with gut content analyses to estimate the fraction of total secondary production derived from various food sources. Secondary production was low in both streams: 4.2 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m22 y21 in BB and 3.0 g AFDM m22 y21 in HB. The amount of primary consumer secondary production derived from algae was 5% in BB and 28% in HB, with the remainder derived from organic detritus. Higher algal availability and lower benthic organic matter storage resulted in a higher fraction of algal consumption in HB relative to BB. Predators consumed ;72 to 92% of total secondary production, producing high predatory losses of insect production. Algal production was not a large food source in either stream because of low availability, possibly caused by shading in BB and possibly nutrient limitation in both streams.",,"['Experimental Forest', 'Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest', 'Hubbard Brook', 'Brook Experimental Forest']"

TWENTYFIVE YEARS OF ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTRUCTED SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA LOISEL MARSHES,"Abstract. Wetland creation and restoration are frequently used to replace ecological functions and values lost when natural wetlands are degraded or destroyed. On many sites, restoration of ecological attributes such as secondary production, habitat/species diversity, and wetland soil characteristics do not occur within the first decade, and no long-term studies exist to document the length of time required to achieve complete restoration of wetland dependent functions and values. Characteristics of community structure (macro- phyte aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter [MOM], benthic invertebrates) and eco- system processes (soil development, organic C, N, and P accumulation) of two constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes (established 1971 and 1974) and paired natural S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina were periodically measured during the past 25 yr. On constructed marshes, the macrophyte community developed quickly, and within 5 to 10 yr, aboveground biomass and MOM were equivalent to or exceeded corresponding values in natural marshes. After 15?€?25 yr, benthic infauna density and species richness were greater than in the natural marshes. Soil bulk density decreased, and organic C and total N increased over time in constructed marshes, but after 25 yr, soil organic C and N reservoirs were much smaller than in a 2000-yr-old natural marsh. Organic C accumulation was similar in constructed and natural marshes with 12?€?24% of the net primary production buried annually. Nitrogen accumulation was much higher in constructed marshes (7?€?12 g??m22 ??yr21) than in natural marshes (2?€?5 g ??m22 ??yr21), reflecting the open biogeochemical cycles and paucity of N in these young ecosystems. Different ecological attributes develop at different rates, with primary producers achieving equivalence during the first 5 yr, followed by the benthic infauna community 5?€?10 yr later. Accumulation of soil nutrients to levels similar to those of reference marshes may require more time.",,['North Carolina']
TwoStep Sintering of Ceramics with Constant GrainSize I Y2O3,"Abstract Isothermal and constant-grain-size sintering have been carried out to full density in Y2O3 with and without dopants, at as low as 40% of the homologous temperature. The normalized densification rate follows Herring?€?s scaling law with a universal geometric factor that depends only on density. The frozen grain structure, however, prevents pore relocation commonly assumed in the conventional sintering models, which fail to describe our data. Suppression of grain growth but not densification is consistent with a grain boundary network pinned by triple-point junctions, which have a higher activation energy for migration than grain boundaries. Long transients in sintering and grain growth have provided further evidence of relaxation and threshold processes at the grain boundary/triple point.","1.

Like the previous studies on Y2O3, the different kinetics between densification diffusion and grain boundary network mobility leaves a kinetic window that can be utilized in the second-step sintering. Evidence indicates that low symmetry, ferroelectric structures still exist in nanograin BaTiO3 ceramics, and that saturation magnetization is the same in nanograin and coarse grain ferrite ceramics.","1.

Uncertainties in satellite remote sensing of aerosols and impact on monitoring its longterm trend a review and perspective,"Abstract. As a result of increasing attention paid to aerosols in climate studies, numerous global satellite aerosol prod- ucts have been generated. Aerosol parameters and underlin- ing physical processes are now incorporated in many general circulation models (GCMs) in order to account for their di- rect and indirect effects on the earth?€?s climate, through their interactions with the energy and water cycles. There exists, however, an outstanding problem that these satellite products have substantial discrepancies, that must be lowered substan- tially for narrowing the range of the estimates of aerosol?€?s cli- mate effects. In this paper, numerous key uncertain factors in the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) are articulated for some widely used and relatively long satellite aerosol products including the AVHRR, TOMS, MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS. We systematically review the algorithms devel- oped for these sensors in terms of four key elements that influence the quality of passive satellite aerosol retrieval: cal- ibration, cloud screening, classification of aerosol types, and surface effects. To gain further insights into these uncertain factors, the NOAA AVHRR data are employed to conduct various tests, which help estimate the ranges of uncertainties incurred by each of the factors. At the end, recommenda- tions are made to cope with these issues and to produce a consistent and unified aerosol database of high quality for both environment monitoring and climate studies.",,[]
Uncertainty in modeling dust mass balance and radiative forcing from size parameterization,"This study examines the uncertainties in simulating mass balance and radiative forcing of mineral dust due to biases in the dust size parameterization. Simulations are con- ducted quasi-globally (180??? W?€?180??? E and 60??? S?€?70??? N) using the WRF-Chem model with three different approaches to represent dust size distribution (8-bin, 4-bin, and 3-5 mode). The biases in the 3-mode or 4-bin approaches against a relatively more accu- rate 8-bin approach in simulating dust mass balance and radiative forcing are identified. Compared to the 8-bin approach, the 4-bin approach simulates similar but coarser size distributions of dust particles in the atmosphere, while the 3-mode approach retains more fine dust particles but fewer coarse dust particles due to its prescribed ??g of each10 mode. Although the 3-mode approach yields up to 10 days longer dust mass lifetime over the remote oceanic regions than the 8-bin approach, the three size approaches produce similar dust mass lifetime (3.2 days to 3.5 days) on quasi-global average, re- flecting that the global dust mass lifetime is mainly determined by the dust mass lifetime near the dust source regions.15",,[]

Albedo is a fundamental parameter in earth sci- ences, and many analyses utilize the Moderate Resolu- tion Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional re- flectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo (MCD43) al- gorithms. While derivative albedo products have been eval- uated over Greenland, we present a novel, direct compar- ison with nadir surface reflectance collected from an un- manned aerial system (UAS). The UAS was flown from Summit, Greenland, on 210 km transects coincident with the MODIS sensor overpass on board the Aqua and Terra satel- lites on 5 and 6 August 2010. Clear-sky acquisitions were available from the overpasses within 2 h of the UAS flights. The UAS was equipped with upward- and downward-looking spectrometers (300?€?920 nm) with a spectral resolution of 10 nm, allowing for direct integration into the MODIS bands 1, 3, and 4. The data provide a unique opportunity to di- rectly compare UAS nadir reflectance with the MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted surface reflectance (NBAR) products. The data show UAS measurements are slightly higher than the MODIS NBARs for all bands but agree within their stated uncertainties. Differences in variability are observed as ex- pected due to different footprints of the platforms. The UAS","During July?€?August 2010, several UAS flights were made over Summit, Greenland. Two of the flights were designed to cover the MODIS swath and were made close in time to the MODIS overpass. The UAS measured the up- and down- welling radiation between 320 and 950 nm with a resolution of 3.3 nm. In this analysis we have made a direct compari- son of reflectance as measured by the UAS with the MODIS NBAR product. The main findings are as follows:",['Greenland']

Use of general regression neural networks for generating the GLASS leaf area index product from timeseries MODIS surface reflectance,"Abstract?€?Leaf area index (LAI) products at regional and global scales are being routinely generated from individual instrument data acquired at a specific time. As a result of cloud contamination and other factors, these LAI products are spatially and temporally discontinuous and are also inaccurate for some vegetation types in many areas. A better strategy is to use multi-temporal data. In this paper, a method was developed to estimate LAI from time-series remote sensing data using general regression neural networks (GRNNs). A database was generated from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and CYCLOPES LAI prod- ucts as well as MODIS reflectance products of the BELMANIP sites during the period from 2001?€?2003. The effective CYCLOPES LAI was first converted to true LAI, which was then combined with the MODIS LAI according to their uncertainties determined from the ground-measured true LAI. The MODIS reflectance was reprocessed to remove remaining effects. GRNNs were then trained over the fused LAI and reprocessed MODIS reflectance for each biome type to retrieve LAI from time-series remote sensing data. The reprocessed MODIS reflectance data from an entire year were inputted into the GRNNs to estimate the 1-year LAI profiles. Extensive validations for all biome types were carried out, and it was demonstrated that the method is able to estimate temporally continuous LAI profiles with much improved accuracy compared with that of the current MODIS and CYCLOPES LAI products. This new method is being used to produce the Global Land Surface Satellite LAI products in China.",,['China.']

Using idealized snow forcing to test teleconnections with the Indian summer monsoon in the Hadley Centre GCM,"Abstract Anomalous heavy snow during winter or spring has long been regarded as a possi- ble precursor of deficient Indian monsoon rainfall during the subsequent summer. However previous work in this field is inconclusive, in terms of the mechanism that communicates snow anomalies to the monsoon summer, and even the region from which snow has the most impact. In this study we explore these issues in coupled and atmosphere-only ver- sions of the Hadley Centre model. A 1050-year control integration of the HadCM3 coupled model, which well represents the seasonal cycle of snow cover over the Eurasian continent, is analysed and shows evidence for weakened monsoons being preceded by strong snow forcing (in the absence of ENSO) over either the Himalaya / Tibetan Plateau or north / west Eurasia regions. However, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of springtime in- terannual variability in snow depth shows the leading mode to have opposite signs between these two regions, suggesting that competing mechanisms may be possible. To determine the dominant region, ensemble integrations are carried out using HadAM3, the atmospheric component of HadCM3, and a variety of anomalous snow forcing initial conditions obtained from the control integration of the coupled model. Forcings are applied during spring in sep- arate experiments over the Himalaya / Tibetan Plateau and north / west Eurasia regions, in conjunction with climatological SSTs in order to avoid the direct effects of ENSO. With the aid of idealized forcing conditions in sensitivity tests, we demonstrate that forcing from the Himalaya region is dominant in this model via a Blanford-type mechanism involving reduced surface sensible heat and longwave fluxes, reduced heating of the troposphere over",,"['Himalaya', 'Hadley Centre', 'Tibetan Plateau']"

Variability of East Asia dust events and their longterm trend,"In order to examine the decadal variations of the dust events over East Asia, we analyze surface observations from 701 meteorological stations for the period 1960?€?2004 to obtain spatial and temporal distributions of dust events. Since the Taklamakan Desert in western China and the Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia are the two major sources of dust storms, we have defined two dust indices, one for the Taklamakan Desert Index (TDI) and one for the Gobi Desert Index (GDI), to characterize the statistical nature of the dust events over these two regions. Both of these indices are well correlated with the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI). TDI and GDI time series exhibit a decreasing trend since the mid-1980s, and is likely caused by an enhanced geopotential height over the Mongolian plateau and the middle Siberian region, as well as by an anomalous shift in the phase and intensity of the stationary wave over. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation in surface energetics during snowmelt in a subarctic mountain catchment,,"This small-scale study has shown dramatic differ- ences in energetics and rates of snow ablation over roughly similar shrub?€?tundra surfaces that are associ- ated with varying slope and aspect. Within this transect of almost 700 m, it was possible to find the range of snow ablation rates and snow-covered area states that one might expect in a north?€?south transect of the entire Mackenzie River basin. The effect of slope and aspect on areal energetics was likely exacerbated by the pro- gressive exposure of shrub. Shrub exposure and asso- ciated albedo decay during melt may have contributed to the dramatic ablation of the south-facing slope over a few sunny days in April, a snow depletion that was not matched by the less sun-exposed surfaces until 5",['Mackenzie River']

Vertical profile of the specific surface area and density of the snow at Dome C and on a transect to Dumont DUrville Antarcticaalbedo calculations and comparison to ,"Abstract. The specific surface area (SSA) of snow deter- mines in part the albedo of snow surfaces and the capacity of the snow to adsorb chemical species and catalyze reactions. Despite these crucial roles, almost no value of snow SSA are available for the largest permanent snow expanse on Earth, the Antarctic. We report the first extensive study of vertical profiles of snow SSA near Dome C (DC: 75???06?€? S, 123???20?€? E, 3233 m a.s.l.) on the Antarctic plateau, and at seven sites dur- ing the logistical traverse between Dome C and the French coastal base Dumont D?€?Urville (DDU: 66???40?€? S, 140???01?€? E) during the Austral summer 2008?€?2009. We used the DU- FISSS system, which measures the IR reflectance of snow at 1310 nm with an integrating sphere. At DC, the mean SSA of the snow in the top 1 cm is 38 m2 kg???1, decreasing monotonically to 14 m2 kg???1 at a depth of 50 cm. Along the traverse, the snow SSA profile is similar to that at DC in the first 600 km from DC. Closer to DDU, the SSA of the top 5 cm is 23 m2 kg???1, decreasing to 19 m2 kg???1 at 50 cm depth. This difference is attributed to wind, which causes a rapid decrease of surface snow SSA, but forms hard wind- packs whose SSA decrease more slowly with time. Since light-absorbing impurities are not concentrated enough to af- fect albedo, the vertical profiles of SSA and density were used to calculate the spectral albedo of the snow for several realistic illumination conditions, using the DISORT radiative transfer model. A preliminary comparison with MODIS data is presented and our calculations and MODIS data show sim- ilar trends.","The data presented here are the first extensive measurements of SSA vertical profiles on the East Antarctic plateau. The concentration of impurities in the snow is sufficiently low not to affect albedo (Grenfell et al., 1994; Warren et al., 2006), and the SSA and density profiles that we obtained can there- fore be used to calculate the hemispherical spectral albedo of the snow, if the effect of surface roughness can be neglected. The albedos thus obtained are, in the IR, lower than those of Grenfell et al. (1994) obtained in 1986 at South Pole. More data is required to assess the significance of this difference,","['DC', 'Dome C', 'Dome']"
Visible and nearultraviolet absorption spectrum of ice from transmission of solar radiation into snow,,"Our measurements of spectral transmission in snow find the wavelength of minimum absorption at 390 nm, consistent with the AMANDA results.

We therefore agree with the conclusions of the AMANDA group: (a) The lab- oratory measurements of attenuation for ??? ??? 600 nm were significantly affected by scattering, and at shorter wavelengths the measured attenua- tion was almost entirely due to scattering.

Vision in bad weather,"Abstract Current vision systems are designed to perform in clear weather. Needless to say, in any outdoor application, there is no escape from ?€?bad?€? weather. Ultimately, computer vi- sion systems must include mechanisms that enable them to function (even if somewhat less reliably) in the presence of haze, fog, rain, hail and snow. We begin by studying the vi- sual manifestations of different weather conditions. For this, we draw on what is already known about atmospheric op- tics. Next, we identify effects caused by bad weather that can be turned to our advantage. Since the atmosphere modulates the information carried from a scene point to the observer, it can be viewed as a mechanism of visual information cod- ing. Based on this observation, we develop models and meth- ods for recovering pertinent scene properties, such as three- dimensional structure, from images taken under poor weather conditions.","8 Conclusion Ultimately, vision systems must be able to handle problems posed by bad weather. This article is no more than an initial attempt at understanding and exploiting the manifestations of weather. We summarized existing models in atmospheric op- tics and proposed new ones, keeping in mind the constraints faced by most vision applications. In addition, we presented three simple algorithms for recovering scene structure from one or two images, without requiring prior knowledge of at- mospheric conditions. We intend to use these results as build- ing blocks for developing more advanced weather-tolerant vi- sion techniques.",[]

Weekly gridded Aquarius Lband radiometerscatterometer observations and salinity retrievals over the polar regionsPart 2 Initial product analysis,"Abstract. Following the development and availability of Aquarius weekly polar-gridded products, this study presents the spatial and temporal radiometer and scatterometer obser- vations at L band (frequency ??? 1.4 GHz) over the cryosphere including the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, sea ice in both hemispheres, and over sub-Arctic land for moni- toring the soil freeze/thaw state. We provide multiple ex- amples of scientific applications for the L-band data over the cryosphere. For example, we show that over the Green- land Ice Sheet, the unusual 2012 melt event lead to an L-band brightness temperature (TB) sustained decrease of ??? 5 K at horizontal polarization. Over the Antarctic ice sheet, normalized radar cross section (NRCS) observations recorded during ascending and descending orbits are sig- nificantly different, highlighting the anisotropy of the ice cover. Over sub-Arctic land, both passive and active obser- vations show distinct values depending on the soil physi- cal state (freeze/thaw). Aquarius sea surface salinity (SSS) retrievals in the polar waters are also presented. SSS varia- tions could serve as an indicator of fresh water input to the ocean from the cryosphere, however the presence of sea ice often contaminates the SSS retrievals, hindering the analy- sis. The weekly grided Aquarius L-band products used are distributed by the US Snow and Ice Data Center at http: //nsidc.org/data/aquarius/index.html, and show potential for cryospheric studies.","The Aquarius/SAC-D satellite mission collects both passive and active L-band observations which offer new capabilities to study and to monitor the polar regions and the cryosphere.

While the penetration depth of the L-band radi- ation in the ice sheet is not well known, Aquarius observa- tions can be useful to retrieve snow and ice properties. These products intend to facilitate the use of combined passive and active L-band observations to study the cryosphere.","['Antarctic', 'US', 'Greenland']"

What caused Earths temperature variations during the last 800000 years Databased evidence on radiative forcing and constraints on climate sensitivity,"The temperature on Earth varied largely in the Pleistocene from cold glacials to interglacials of different warmths. To contribute to an understanding of the underlying causes of these changes we compile various environmental records (and model-based inter- pretations of some of them) in order to calculate the direct effect of various processes on Earth?€?s radiative budget and, thus, on global annual mean surface temperature over the last 800,000 years. The importance of orbital variations, of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, of the albedo of land ice sheets, annual mean snow cover, sea ice area and vegetation, and of the radiative perturbation of mineral dust in the atmosphere are investigated. Altogether we can explain with these processes a global cooling of 3.9 ?? 0.8 K in the equilibrium temperature for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) directly from the radiative budget using only the Planck feedback that parametrises the direct effect on the radiative balance, but neglecting other feedbacks such as water vapour, cloud cover, and lapse rate. The unaccounted feedbacks and related uncertainties would, if taken at present day feedback strengths, decrease the global temperature at the LGM by ???8.0 ?? 1.6 K. Increased Antarctic temperatures during the Marine Isotope Stages 5.5, 7.5, 9.3 and 11.3 are in our conceptual approach difficult to explain. If compared with other studies, such as PMIP2, this gives supporting evidence that the feedbacks themselves are not constant, but depend in their strength on the mean climate state. The best estimate and uncertainty for our reconstructed radiative forcing and LGM cooling support a present day equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding the ice sheet and vegetation components) between 1.4 and 5.2 K, with a most likely value near 2.4 K, some- what smaller than other methods but consistent with the consensus range of 2???4.5 K derived from other lines of evidence. Climate sensitivities above 6 K are difficult to reconcile with Last Glacial Maximum reconstructions.",,"['Planck', 'Earth']"

Winter rain on snow and its association with air temperature in northern Eurasia,"This study examines the characteristics of winter (Dec?€?Feb) rain-on-snow events and their relationship to surface air temperatures to reveal potential changes in rain-on-snow days under a warming climate over northern Eurasia. We found that rain-on-snow events mostly occur over European Russia during winter. Rain-on-snow days increase as air temperature increases and are primarily attributable to the increase in rainfall days. Air temperature is the primary cause for these changes, while the North Atlantic Oscillation has some influence on the rain on snow and rainfall over the northern part of European Russia. The magnitude of rain-on-snow increase ranges from 0??5 day to 2??5 days per degree Celsius increase in air temperature. Higher rates of increase in rain-on-snow days occur in the northern and eastern parts of European Russia where the air temperature is lower, in contrast to rainfall days which have higher rates at locations with higher air temperatures. This suggests that a decrease in snowfall days might be limiting the rate of increase in rain-on-snow events over warmer regions where the temperature is about ???8 ??C or higher. This study also implies that rain-on-snow days will become more common over regions in which it is currently a rare event as air temperatures increase.

ZnO transparent thin films for gas sensor applications,,"The effect of plasma gas flow ratio (Ar to O2) on the morphology of ZnO thin films and their correlation with the optical properties and conductivity changes of the films were investigated. AFM and XRD characterization of the films revealed polycrystalline morphology with roughness increa- sing as the argon partial pressure increases. The surface of the films grown from ceramic targets had a complete different morphology, which is mainly dominated by grain agglome- ration and the presence of very tall features. ZnO films sputtered from a metallic target in pure oxygen plasma show smaller grains, smaller Egap and as-deposited conductivity values. Moreover, they exhibit better sensitivity to ozone due to larger surface-to-volume ratio. On the contrary films sputtered from a ceramic target at high Ar concentration in the plasma show larger Egap, better conductivity and much worse sensitivity to ozone.",[]
